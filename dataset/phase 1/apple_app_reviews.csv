"1","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Love the app, up to date and timely notifications. I would give 5 stars, except I do not want to see COVID info all over the map, and when I change settings it doesn’t store. I either have to keep the app open, or change settings every time I open it. Time zone doesn’t store either. No settings store.","4"
"2","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I had to take this off my old phone when it ran out of memory, but I re-added it on my new phone immediately. It is fascinating, albeit a little alarming to see problems all around the world!  It’s amazing to realize that our lifestyle here in the United States is responsible for so many earthquakes, floods, volcanoes and droughts all over the planet! To think that all hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and health pandemics are the fault of fat lazy Americans driving Hummers makes me sad to be breathing air on this precious planet. Naturally NONE of these things ever happened before America came along. I’d kill myself it this app weren’t so darn interesting.","5"
"3","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","First off wouldn’t recognize my login information, had to create a new account. Not too much of a big deal but then I tried using the app..... horrible. The interface is real buggy, you have to tap on a location 30 times before it will actually register that you tapped it. Im sure the information from this app is great since it’s from the PDC, but it doesn’t help if you can’t even select the items you want the information from. Trying to change user preferences is basically impossible, I tried something as simple as changing the time zone. Wouldn’t recognize Tokyo as a time zone, then tried to select it by country but wouldn’t even let me select japan. Already given up, if the app can’t handle the basic things, then I don’t trust it to do anything else. From what I’ve been reading, it was great before a major update. My suggestion go back.","1"
"4","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","This is a fantastic app I’d like to see being used worldwide! Using a system of communication with government disaster alerts and social media to communicate with the public in the line of fire, what others may not, we can all be quickly informed of local disasters to drive around, like CA fires, or when an earthquake across the world will or will not produce a tsunami threat! Great resource! Thank you to the dedicated staff working all ours to give us the latest weather & disaster related information like hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, fires & more! Most current, local info at your fingertips!","5"
"5","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I just posted a few days ago.  When I first got this app a couple of years ago, it worked great.  Then with each update to “improve” the app, things kept getting worse.  The last time I posted that I’d have to delete & reinstall this app because just a day or two after installing, the symbol you tap on to view the disasters would disappear & there was no way to get it back.  So I reinstalled it for the 3rd time 2 days ago & the following day, that symbol disappeared again!  I’ll never install this one again.  A complete waste of my time.   I will find a disaster app that will work.  My job requires that I stay abreast of worldwide disasters.","1"
"6","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","This app leaves out or they don't know of other reported events that happens as the earthquake in Northwest Tennessee on Feb. 2017 never showed up on this app ! There need to be a archives search on this app for back information, if you want to track back history. Nothing reported on nuclear waste of Japan Monitoring or other sites. No links to lake or river pollution levels that each U.S. state documents and reports. I probably want keep this app much longer ! If you get this app opp out of notices an alert ! You'll get pop ups all the time ! You can turn off in the app also !","3"
"7","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","My job depends on international situational awareness and an up to date understanding of national and international level disasters. This app sends me so many alerts of so many “disasters”, many of them months old, that anything of actual significance gets totally washed out. This is after I upgraded the app and set the notification level to warning only. Maybe if you’re looking for something that covers a specific, hyper local area, there could be some use in it. Otherwise, keep looking. Totally disappointed since I’m also an EMOPs user and that app is great for building regional knowledge and understanding.","2"
"8","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","This used to be my first choice app for keeping current with emergencies in our area.  However, they have “improved” it to the point of making it useless.    Our area has rather frequent flooding rain storms.  This app used to give timely and accurate notifications as soon as they were posted by Civil Defense.  Now, the app gives notifications, but instead of giving useful information, it will almost always state that the notice has expired - even just seconds after the notice was posted!   IT IS UTTERLY USELESS!    Now, after the most recent update, it won’t clear the notifications count.  It will clear temporarily, but as soon as there is another notification, the count will return showing the number of ALL of the notifications since the update, not just the current number.    I have found the Red Cross Emergency app to be much more accurate and informative.","2"
"9","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I don't know about other people but sometimes I get tunnel vision and tend to focus more on what is going on in my little corner of the world. This app has been an eye opener for me in terms of the bigger picture about calamities occurring all over our world. It is sobering to see so many disasters and makes me much more appreciative of each day. The app is easy to navigate and very informative. It's definitely a keeper.","5"
"10","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I found Disaster Alert to be a very effective in all its areas of operations, of course I installed it on a new iPad, my old iPad was limited my memory, it runs flawlessly at the speed of a fast internet connection, I have been a director of Emergency Medical Services in South Texas with many Cities, I know the importance of early warning, keep up the Good Work, all involved here.","5"
"11","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Have used the app for years, very informative!  Keeps me abreast of natural disasters around the world.  Now this New and improved (?) app opens to a glob of icons, requiring massive zooming to try and locate the alert just received.  Then switching to the text of the alerts keeps part of the map showing, requiring you to search the larger text boxes for what you are looking for.  That made the app more cumbersome to use.","3"
"12","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I had this app a few years ago it was great back then. When the big earthquake hit Montana this year, I remembered this app and quickly went to download it for future events. It's been a while now and Montana currently has 175,000 acres on fire right now and not one notification has popped up. I see notifications of tornados two years ago and fires in other states but nothing but dry weather conditions warnings. This app is useless to me if I can't have current events for my state. Just about to delete this app unfortunately.","1"
"13","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","If the goal with the last couple of updates was to make the app less useful and a mess to navigate, then the developers nailed it. You used to be able to tap and alert and see what it was....sort of an obvious thing you would want to do...No more. Now you have to hunt around to find information on the alert. Overall some major steps backwards.  Any chance we can roll it back to the useful app it used to be?","2"
"14","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I love this app and rely on it a lot! It’s very informative (usually)  The only complaint I have is the app is very buggy. It’s glitches a ton and I can barely move around the map accuracy. Other then that I love that app and am very happy with it.","4"
"15","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","The older app on my iPad3 worked great.  On this newer iPad Pro, the app updated.  I can’t seem to keep the layers I want to stay displayed from each auto-update.  Each time I have to reselect all the layers.  As a disaster specialist, I am currently needing only a few of the layers.  It’s a waste of my time.  Yup, it may be my lack of understanding how to use this app.  It does have super options.  It appears to be really well done, but it’s this one feature that is keeping me from giving it a full five stars.  If someone can help, I would appreciate it.","1"
"16","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Already liked the previous version which had been used by local EMS and Fire Dept to allocate resources. This new update has many more layers and customizable options for any given area as well as the flexibility for world-wide travel. Lots of info provided in real time.","5"
"17","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","This app has a nice world map that shows different types of disasters around the world.  Two big fails that you may or may not care about; 1. Incomplete data.  Apparently the volcano in Hawaii didn’t qualify as a disaster.  Three high wind/storm warnings: check!  Volcano: 0.  2. This thing is spammy on the alerts.  To be fair there are a lot of disasters going on in the world every single day.  IOS 12 will bring alert grouping, maybe they’re counting on that.  Or perhaps it’s to encourage people to subscribe ($$$) to the premium alert feature to prioritize daily alerts in areas of interest you select?  Fix the data quality issues and I’d pay a couple bucks for this app, but a subscription?  Heck no!","2"
"18","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Why I have it 5 stars, 1 it is free and 4 because of the amount of data it puts into the app.  There are minor tweaks I would like to see but for what I paid and what I get I can not complain. Excellent information and easy to use.","5"
"19","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","A vision into what’s happening in our world the ring of fire is a lot more active than I ever thought. It gives you information on earthquakes, avalanches, etc. I haven’t found a better app yet.","5"
"20","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","The newly updated app is at best the worst design possible. The earlier app ver was basic but simple and clearly organized. This app is an absolute mess and is fit to be taken down. Apple’s threshold for app performance is now apparently really low. The app on iphone 6 causes the screen to shrink both from the top and bottom. There is no “Settings” menu. I cannot even now revert to the old version. Crap.","1"
"21","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I rather liked their old app with satellite view and it was quick to pull up disasters and clear the screen once it was read.  There’s kinks that has to be ironed out and I hope the developers can fix this","4"
"22","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Could use some graphics simplifying.  Remember, it’s a phone or tablet app; not a laptop or desktop version.  KISS principle","4"
"23","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Before this new version I really liked and relied on Alerts notifications. Now this new app is a day late almost everyday. My area location is in the Pacific and appreciated Tropical Depression and Storm warning notifications.  Will rate 5 stars once improvements made.","3"
"24","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Used to like the app, loads the info instantly when you tap on it...after the update, it takes a long time before loading the info because of the map layers & others. I hope they remove unnecessary infos that cause the app to lag.","2"
"25","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Update fixed slow load of hazards very informative app","5"
"26","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I have been very surprised of the activities around the world. I travel world wide and this app really helps let me know what the region I’m going to conditions are and great for planning ahead.","5"
"27","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I live in Northern California, this app makes me aware of and keeps me updated about any wildfires in my area in a succinct and attention grabbing way.","5"
"28","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","In searching for some of the disasters quoted in the app, I looked up mentions of tornadoes and other events occurring in the United States by checking the weather channels and the Google references. I was not seeing correlations between listed disasters on this app and occurrences in the areas where the disasters were listed.","2"
"29","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Love it. Keeps me updated on the entire world and it’s fascinating to see how many things are happening in the world.","5"
"30","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","It is wonderful to receive the various disaster alerts around the world. I feel like I always know what is going on. I use this app everyday!.","5"
"31","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Awesome apps!!  Very accurate detail current information. Want to thank DisasterAlert for putting out best public alert notification for everyone’s safety. Mahalo🤙🏽","5"
"32","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","After the upgrade I can now customize my alerts for free - no more monthly bills!","5"
"33","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I live in West Africa and this provides very useful information that otherwise isn’t available.","5"
"34","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I had a similar app on my old phone, but it doesn’t compare to this one! Stellar and highly accurate!","5"
"35","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Sometimes a little slow to load, but one of my more used apps for keeping an eye on weather events.","4"
"36","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","The Hazard List button is missing. The hazard list topic titles get cut off and can’t be read; I liked the scrolling bring that back. Weather Layer default-on not good. Doesn’t save User Prefs so has to be reset every time. and I am a paid-up user for years. Keeps getting worse.","2"
"37","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Excellent app I recommended for stay alert all time about the world","5"
"38","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I want the previous version back. why? Because it takes too long to load and is slow when moving to different areas within the site. I always began each day by looking at the global weather, but now I can’t be bothered.","1"
"39","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Although I appreciate your service, the new program is not nearly as friendly as the past program. Please bring back the old format, or do a design change to allow favorable use. Even submitting this review is burdensome.","2"
"40","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","App is okay but you can't filter alerts to ones that have any sort of relevance to you. They also try you to pay a logre monthly or yearly fee for things that should be free. I would have been open to paying a smaller, one-time fee, but clearly they have not tested this with a market yet.","1"
"41","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I really like this app.  It’s a great tool in understanding our earth and what happens around the world.","4"
"42","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Really helpful to see what's happening out there, especially when I'm on the road.","5"
"43","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","yo you can’t go to the map very much but if you had the bell on  it alerts you for any disaster happening","5"

"49","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I used this app for years, but either has new ownership from 2018, cause it just does not work. Can’t get to see anything. The app only asks for Reviews!  It’s really weak now.  Please fix your App up!","2"
"50","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Well done. Good too see all new maps & features. Much better, but best there is.","5"
"51","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Love the new updates! Great app. I work in the science department of our local high school, this app is perfect for work.","5"
"52","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","They give constant notifications about things happening all over the world that arent even disasters. Idc about a flood in lebannon. I tried to edit the preferences and they made me create an account. No thanks i will just delete. Good idea terrible execution. Dissapointed. Just goofy honestly","1"
"53","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Easy to use.","5"
"54","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","This is an excellent app to provide a very broad sense of situational awareness. I use it to maintain a regional situational awareness for emerging weather events and potential impacts.","5"
"55","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","User friendly, situational awareness with access to multiple emergency management disaster preparedness related layers.  Civilian version of PDC’s EMOPS in your hip pocket!","5"
"56","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Excellent app keeps me up to speed with what’s going on around the world","5"

"66","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","The updated ruined what was an awesome app.  Makes me very sad.  Hoping they will bring back the old look and functionality of what it once was.. Bring back the old format. Don’t like it all much anymore.","1"
"67","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","It used to have an easy access to a list.  Now they complicated it. Very technical.  Does not works for me at all.  I will erased and try something else.  Hope I find something better.","1"

"70","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Excellent coverage and valuable app!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND","5"
"71","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","At last. Shows all EQs hurricane paths, & fires. And no charge for limiting notifications. Thx guys.","5"
"72","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","It’s an okay app. If the newest alerts were at the top of the feed, I believe it could be better.","3"
"73","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Fantastic App. I highly recommend it. Must have. A+","5"
"74","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","The map rarely updates, always a day behind. Do not rely on this app to notify you in an actual emergency situation.","2"

"93","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","this would be a great app if you could navigate back","1"
"94","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","You will be surprised how many calamities are occuring around the globe and how uninformed you have been.  Most impressive is the zooming function, which to my eyes looks to have a higher resolution than google earth.  It must been a live satellite feed or something.  One shortcoming is that the details option opens up in a screen that is not scaled to fit the iphone screen, so you have to zoom in.","4"
"95","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Don’t do it","1"
"96","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Aloha nui loa from the Big Island...  Great application guys. Very nicely done and very useful. Just a couple of suggestions, it would be great if the map was 'infinite' (that is, didn't stop scrolling in the middle of the pacific) - hard to get from Hawaii to Japan without going the wrong way :)  Or maybe just make Hawaii the middle of the map (after all, it IS the PACIFIC warning system :)  It would also be nice that new warnings would be marked with a little NEW badge (or something like that) if the warning was new since the last time I ran the application.  Push notification would be great too, to put a badge on the application icon indicating the number of new alerts.  Finally, having a current location that took you to your place on the map would also be a nice touch (again, may have missed it, but I didn't see it).  Great application!","5"
"97","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I agree with some of the other reviewers that with the login screen it is now slow to start up.  Even if I try to choose to log in as a Guest it sometimes takes several taps on that link until it responds. Also, if this is the Pacific Disaster Center app then why does the map always default over by the Atlantic and not on the Pacific? Are there more African and European users of this app than the rest of the world?  I do appreciate the disaster info this app provides.  I was hoping that the customized alerts would have been a one time app purchase rather than a subscription.","3"
"98","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","The app does just what it said ... provides a visual reference to types of disaster alerts and locates the various events on a world map as well as provide a link to more information.  I especially like that the map continues ... so you aren't limited to a continent 1/2 on the left and 1/2 on the right.  You just scroll and you put what you like right where you want it.  User interface is very nice.","5"
"99","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I have friends and family all over the world. This app lets me see what is going on in their area, so I can offer assistance to them, or just check in to make sure they are ok. From earthquakes in China to Typhoons heading for Taiwan, the app is full of up to the minute information and also links you further to treasure troves of information and details if desired. Great Job!!!","5"
"100","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I don't know how they did this, but the developers of this app have made it fast and simple for geographers, geologists, meteorologists, and folks who have family they are concerned about to get up to speed and fast about potential and existing disasters. The developers should be applauded. The graphics are very appealing to boot. Thank you.","5"
"101","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Great app, although some of the notifications are unnecessary.  Any earthquake 5.0 or greater becomes an alert, and most quakes are not an issue until they are 6.0 or greater. The same is true for many severe thunderstorms, blizzards, and other notifications that I would not characterize as 'disaster alerts'.  Good situational awareness though; great insight into just how frequently events happen all over the globe.","4"
"102","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Great app well thought out very informative and intuitive. I spent well over an hour exploring it and learned quite a lot. I felt very informed when the day after I bought it I heard mention of tropical storm Jose. From your app I already knew of it, where it was, it's projected path and more.  Thanks for the app. I recommend it to anyone who likes being informed.","5"
"103","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","This is a great app in its layout and information.  The only thing I would like to see added is the ability to set each category of disaster to certain thresholds.    For example, I don't need to receive notifications about fires which are beyond a 20 mile radius from me.  I also don't need to hear about earthquakes below 7.0 and which are outside of a 500 mile radius (or are not a tsunami threat).    At the very least, please add filters for distance and severity of each disaster category.    Maybe also tie into local emergency broadcast services to provide text alerts from civil defense in cities, counties, states, provinces, countries, etc.","4"
"104","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","however; I would love to be able to sort the events by time. That is going and sort them by hours ago minutes ago. Currently the times come up apparently random maybe they're sorted by geography somehow. But to be able to sort them by time would be very very cool","5"
"105","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Application provides two views of hazards occurring around the world. The map shows visual context while the listing is a no-frills type representation. Each hazard has a link to more details.  Very informative application and look forward to future functionality.","5"
"106","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Nice to have at hand an app where you can check the status of an event. Here in Hawaii everytime you hear of an earthquake somewhere in the Pacific, Alaska or Japan, you wonder tsunami? Now we can check and drive to the gas station to top off  Would be nice to have push notifications though.","5"
"107","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I love this app.  Even though I do not live in a disaster-prone area, I have family & friends that do.  This app gives timely and accurate info on all type of natural disasters and keeps me aware of just how much activity there is around the globe! I don't liv in a perfect bubble after all!  Thanks!","5"
"108","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I check it every day. Just wish the connected additional information was more informative and easier to read. I would like to know more about the volcanos like type of eruption and size of plume or flow etc. And for earthquakes..... Are there tsunamis etc.","4"
"109","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Crashes every couple of minutes, very annoying as you can imagine. Ability to scroll completely around the globe has to be added or a constantly moving globe that can be rotated like in google earth. Apart from that it is an interesting app that will keep me informed at all times wherever I may be.","3"
"110","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","This app actually works. I doubt the accuracy of this app at first, but the information it provided me was quite accurate. But i don't know for sure whether it is really that accurate... so 4 stars. Interface could be improved as well.","4"
"111","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","This is quite a novel App. Useful when considering travel, which I was to Washington, but now that I see fires reported- ill check into this more. Would like landscape support and ability to send alerts as email. Server being used is slow however.","5"
"112","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I LOVE this app! While living on an island in the Pacific Ocean it kept me up to date on what was happening not only to my area but also around the world! Now back in the states I can still track the weather where ever friends and family live! Thank you!","5"
"113","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Great application.  I' not sure what all a paid subscription would do, exactly (and this would be good to exactly know); however, given the info is free from many other locations... I think $1 or $2 or $3 per year (at different customizable levels) would be more reasonable and bring more paying subscriptions.  Almost there!","3"
"114","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","As a Security professional who oversees the health and security of many teams all over the world this app is a great way to stay alert to many disasters where our teams are as they happen. It helps me stay on top of such things","5"
"115","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I like the app, but unless you have many, many friends and or family around the globe, no point in downloading this app. If you want one just for your region, just get your local news app. They report disasters too...","5"
"116","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Disaster Alert!  Mostly good.  Could use better global back-ground graphics, but really needs the ability to customize which alerts I want to receive as push notifications.","4"
"117","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Our business relies on accuracy.  Your up to the minute data has helped to provide that out front information which allows for actionable trainning.  That alone makes it invaluable.  Great App.","5"
"118","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Interesting fusion of available information, I like the app, however wish I could filter the alerts I receive without becoming a paying customer.","5"
"119","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Loved this app before...but it got even better with the new update!! Love the ability to add Layers now! And flip out Menu on left is great! Other functions are improved also. 😊","5"
"120","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Great app made better with push notices. Next step should be to give folks the ability to CHOOSE the alerts they want. Example, I'm only interested in tsunami and/or Hawaii alerts. Until then, I have to turn the notices off.","4"
"121","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","There should be an option that takes advantage of Location Services where the app tells you alerts near you. But other than that, great!","4"
"122","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","This app has exactly what I am looking for. Quick snapshot of what's going on around the globe with good info that assists me in my job.  Would recommend to anyone in this line of work.","5"
"123","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Of course there are additional alerts that should be included in this program. Wars, biological terrorism, and so on, and (which I would really like to see), response levels to these emergencies. We need to take care of what we can.","4"
"124","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I like this product a great deal, it's nice to have an overview of events and I got info on the china quake before it was on the news. That Said I think that up UBAlert is a very good compliment to this app as it allows users to input local data . In short I'd say get both since this one has slightly better event reporting.","3"
"125","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I appreciate being able to know what events are happening around the world, however I think the price could be reduced significantly .   You would probably get a lot more customers by charging $2.99 for the app.   The free version does not provide enough information so many people will delete the app.  Reconsider your policy, you receive a considerable amount of money through the government and grants.","4"
"126","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","This app helps keep track of all the disasters and other bad things happening around the globe and is extremely helpful. Highly recommended!!","5"
"127","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","It's interesting to use the maps above and beyond the reporting on natural disasters. This app provides a really interesting view of the world.","5"
"128","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I usually love this app, I like the constant alerts to earthquakes, volcanoes, disease outbreaks, etc. I still get alerted about Ebola and I WANT to be! HOWEVER--The [more info] button for the Ebola pandemic alert hasn't changed since August 11th! I tried reloading but it still says only about 950 people have died (like it was in August), and we all know that that number has grown.  If you guys can fix this lack of Ebola updates I'll go back to 5 stars again......  Disappointed because this is THE PACIFIC DISASTER CENTER! A large reputable company!  So come on guys fix the Ebola thing and make it more accurate and up to date please! Then I can go back up to 5 stars. Thanks! :/","1"
"129","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Alerts are too high volume and irrelevant unless you can customize. Can't customize alerts unless you pay for a subscription. At their current rates subscriptions are even more expensive than registering your own domain name (for example). Not worth it; in general I don't think I would pay any subscription fee for an app like this.","1"

"143","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","A very nice fusion of many bits of data over a wide range of event classifications.  Adding a cat agony for NBC (nuclear, biological and chemical) events would be beneficial...especially in our current world socio-political & nation-state flux.","5"

"152","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","This App appears not to be accurate.  There is massive flooding in Fiji right now and yet no alert on this App.  Also, it shows a Tsunami alert in Hawaii and yet further information says there is no Tsunami alert for Hawaii.  Go figure.    The other Disaster Alert app IS this one....they're both inaccurate.","1"

"200","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","A long time ago my app stopped receiving information from the PDC.  The app is just there, with a map on it and nothing else: no alerts, no information, no nothing.","1"

"235","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","This app is an eye opener, providing a barometer for overall planetary events. By constant monitoring, it becomes easy to differentiate between areas hit by random events and those area which are repeatedly struck yet possessing causal connections.  Impossible to remain a passive citizen with so many in need of help.   The concepts I communicate are not simple casual observations, but rather, in these times, areas being struck using a paradigms which states, the Designer, will use whatever force necessary to cull out those factors contributing to over all planetary decay, as influenced by then moral (or lack there of)  ethical stance of the people affected.  It's interesting to study large land masses and the people inhabiting those areas. Save for islands and segment nations positioned on vastly active plate regions, there is a definite connection between the disasters of say, Japan and The US both of which share is compablw moral decadence.    There are some locations, skilled with manipulation of stated freedoms for those whom they deceive,   Japan has an well concealed pornograaphic home delivery system establishes with salons and hotel backing that goes beyond comprehension.  When the tsunami hit in 2010 with like the straw that broke the camels back.  If there were a caring creator, willing to act locally and globally, the areas being positioned for strikes frequently are those areas of maximum depraavity and moral decay.

"250","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I have been using this app for a few months.I find it to be informative about what is happening with weather nationally and worldwide.This knowledge makes me more aware that we are a global community and all people on the planet are connected to one another because weather impacts everyone.","5"
"251","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I work in disaster relief. I’ve been using this APP for about one month now.  I just received a tornado warning 4/14/19 around 1424 EST in our state that said “reported 24 min ago” and we have NOTHING here (yet). HOW CAN WE RELY ON OLD INCONSISTENT DATA? I too, will be deleting this APP. Tornados from yesterday are popping up left and right with updates and I don’t have TIME to see these hazards days, weeks and months old. What a shame, developers need to see the feedback and apply it. This has great potential, but in today’s world, accuracy, speed, and reliability are EVERYTHING.","2"
"252","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","For free, you get a lot of intimate information of worldwide trauma. I like the symbols differentiating events and the level of detail provided for each one. Since each event seems to provide  proprietary detail, the load of such detail takes some time. Nonetheless, information is comprehensive and well worth the free price tag. This does not replace early warning detection as one moron of a user expected it should but it does help understand disasters as they are happening. I would love to see another layer, showing significant events such as wars or civil unrest. This is a great idea for an application that I hope can be built upon with more features.

"267","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I am impressed with the frequent updates relating to the horrific earthquakes and tsunamis that started in Japan.  I am NOT impressed with your LACK OF INFORMATION provided to Californians. other than a general Pacific Warning, there is NOTHING ABOUT THE tsunami's Impact and destruction of property in Cresent City, CA; Santa Cruz, CA, Ventura CA and points beyond and in-between.  As a California Central Coast resident I feel deceived by the sense of false trust your app provided.   I was contacted by a friend who let me know which communities were being evacuated IN MY LOCAL COMMUNITY - There are still no Tsunami Watches or Warning posted on you site.  Half assed, is half assed, and in my opinion a poor excuse for a organization that portrays itself to be a legitimate Pan-Pacific or world wide warning service.  I am deleting your app!","1"

"270","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","I seriously think ya'll need to contract with governmental agencies and seek grant money and/or sub contracts for this app. It's OUTSTANDING!!! I was looking for a one-stop-shopping app for disaster & emergency preparedness and yours is about as close as I've seen. This is what modern society needs! Your product is well designed, great UI and imminently useful. It needs to be utilized at governmental levels--why is it that I get better information from your app than my own U.S. municipality's so-called Emergency Management department?  This app is worth the price & I'd love to see your continued development. Ideas:  / Customizable news feeds reader sortable by key word & by zip/postal code (ala Gnews). Collaborating with a newsreader beyond your emergency sources lets users follow media in the disaster region. Gnews is a great highly customizable reader for free google news feeds; it allows a robust keyword & zipcode customization, which lets you track key disaster terms in your own backyard (hopefully not your own backyard, of course, but maybe the backyard of a neighboring community, like the one the boss lives in.)   / resource page of links to disaster/emergency preparedness sites--this is very trendy in US markets now with the so-called Prepper movement. Or maybe create a user social message board. Something like Resources for Drought, for Earthquakes, Wildfires etc. Also possible links to or templates for Disaster Plans and other useful information so people can be prepared BEFORE disaster strikes. No matter how cool it is to watch on your app, it's a lot less cool to live with it! :-)  / And yes, Push Notifications. Preferably with some type of fairly robust customization; eg push Earthquake but not Hurricane, or push only earthquake >5.0 or Hurricane > cat 2.","5"
"271","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","Not very good app. Has a lot of problems with the new operating system.would not recommend downloading.","2"
"272","Disaster Alert (PDC Global)","A great app.important & informative","5"
"1","FEMA","I wish there was infirmation on where to find all this if the emergency includes not having any access to the web (and probably an afterthought because by the time you realize it it will be in full swing because you dont have any other way anymore in which you get warnings like weather reports or any contingency plans that the public is informed via public service announcements anymore like it used to on radio or tv. We really rely on an app now for this? Kind of a bad contingency plan - I seem to remember beibg in Paris in 2017 when the customs and security servers and computers went down in the airport. That was a great mess. Hmmm no one seems to think that was something to learn from.  oh well, I guess I can go study what I think has been planned and then go wander around ahead of time so I become familiar with the road to the last bottle of water and toilet paper in my local grocery. Or look up and write down all the ways I can get in touch with my cell carrier to tell them my service is not working. Does anyone have a white pages phone book? I have to report it online now because they no longer have people answering phones for customer service.","3"
"2","FEMA","So the freeze warning was extended, or maybe some other fairly normal weather event gets reported, and the weather alert notification dings and wakes us at all times of the night.  I like to keep the sound on for notification in case there is some real extreme weather developing, but I really don’t care to be advised that a freeze advisory has been extended at 2:15 am.  I should be allowed to define what types of weather I consider critical or minor, and the notification with sound should only be used for what I define as critical events.  A farmer may have different needs than a taxi driver or a builder or a writer of suspense novels, just to name a few.  95% of all the alerts are for things I either know about (I looked at the forecast, I can hear the thunder or the heavy rain, etc), or have a reasonable expectation will not affect me much (flash flooding typically doesn’t affect the places I go, beyond the fact that visibly heavy rain creates conditions for hydroplaning).","3"
"3","FEMA","I downloaded this app for one reason only , I live in a National forest town and there’s big storms when they happen like wildfires. However, how am I supposed to take it seriously when I’ve set my notifications to only one reminder every 24 hours and yet I get (I’ve counted before complaining) about 6 of the same notification at one time every hour. You do the math. 6x24 for one location for one person for one day. You notify me 144 times a day!!!! I couldn’t even begin to save a life with my phone going off like this! And then you’re notifying me for wind and little bits of rain and places that are at least 20 miles away from me when I very specifically only want my location! Once a day for the same storm. You make me want to turn my phone off but I can’t because i use my phone for work and as I’ve said I can’t delete your app because I live in a dangerous location to not have warnings of floods, avalanches, fires, etc. stop annoying me!! I said one notification every 24 hours and honestly I only need one notification. Period. I really hate this app but I have to have it or I would delete.","1"
"4","FEMA","I wish there were a way to test the audio alert to make sure that I know what it sounds like and that it is in fact working and coming through the speakers. I have the app set up on an iPad in the living room and hopes that being centrally located we would be notified of any of the alerts that we have it set to.   There are plenty of weather alert apps but I chose this one in hopes that other emergencies will be broadcast as well. I actually wanted some kind of emergency broadcast system app but none seems to be available. So I’m hoping this app also alerts to other kinds of emergencies besides acts of you know who. Such as National alerts due to terrorism and the like. There is a local alerts setting (last button) but that is very broad, it would be nice to know those other types of alerts will be broadcast.","3"
"5","FEMA","One of the worst written & maintained apps ever. I'm generously granting 2 stars; likely before deleting it. For way too long it issued reminders I had set, a feature discontinued, settings removed, but still active. I had all app notifications switched off in iOS for relief. Now a minor but annoying bug: click Alerts button at the bottom, choose a location, click Alert Preferences... and the back arrow nor click the Close button function. They visibly depress is all. Must force-close the app. Fortunately changes are saved. Clearly this app is not tested or maintained diligently. Totally forgivable if privately authored & free to use, but if this is government funded, please discontinue all funding & spend elsewhere, or as a much lower preference fix this app's functionality & reliability. I might reinstall should I end up in a disaster area, if I think about it. Otherwise, after at least a couple of years now I'm fed up.","2"
"6","FEMA","11/18 I decided to try one last thing for completely deleting this app. I updated to current version (2.11.3). All my previously saved locations were back. We’ll see how it works going forward, but I am hopeful. Thanks for the fix.  11/6 While I used to receive multiple alerts for the same issue, the recent update broke the app and wiped all settings and saved locations. Most well-designed apps have the ability to retain config settings during an update. What is strange is that I continue to get alert notifications for my saved locations, even though I cannot view the alerts or see (or re-add) my locations. So perhaps they’re not cleared after all, just somehow inaccessible. Seems like a fundamental flaw in the update. I will wait for an update rather than delete and reinstall. Thankfully fire season is nearly behind us in CA.","4"
"7","FEMA","Edit 2: Thank you for responding. I have a suggestion regarding to badge icon. Why not create an option to turn on or off the “persist” with settings like how many numbers or how long to keep them on. I do understand why you wanted to keep the badge notifications on and I agree with your reasons. But it annoying because when storms passed by in my area, we’re not in danger anymore but still on weather watch in other areas. Original comment: And I have been using this app for a couple of years or so. Very useful! However, the notification icon showing numbers of alerts on app icon always stay on. I went into app and read, went through every articles and alerts. The numbers still shows on the app icon. Annoying!","4"
"8","FEMA","The information is there, so that’s good, but generally the App is a little clumsy and doesn’t have the most intuitive UI.  A couple of things I’d like to see the developer address please: 1. Notifications:  if my App has a red number “badge” meaning there’s a (quantity of) new notification(s) in the app, this should be intuitive to find, and reflect the number.  My expectation: red badge “2” = open app and see 2 new alerts.  If an alert has expired and is no longer there, it shouldn’t be in the badge alert count. Thank you.  2. Request: it would be really useful to have a “share” button on the alerts. E.g. We run a small family rural Ag business and I try to share occasional frost Alerts with our customers (like a sudden frost after a warm spell or first frost of the season).  “Share” would be great.  I especially want to always share “do not burn” alerts on business Facebook page. Currently I take a screen shot, but the alert is usually longer than one screenshot.  Thank you for reading and I hope these changes are possible.","3"
"9","FEMA","Update:  sorry it has taken so long to post. All issues I had have been resolved. Appreciate the weather warnings in my area so I know how to plan. Thank you.   New app constantly shows weather alerts with the red exclamation point even though there are no alerts. Even when there are alerts it won’t go away after reading the warning. Getting to and reading warnings takes more steps now. What is wrong with simplicity?. Each time an app (not just this one) updates it goes from easy to use to overloaded and complicated. Other weather apps are easier to use. Will give this one a bit longer to fix issues then I’m gone if I’m still having problems","5"
"10","FEMA","Please see in future updates if you can increase the number of locations available to seven. My home county of Russell County, Alabama is surrounded by six other counties. Three counties in Alabama, and three counties in Georgia. I would have liked to have at least added Macon County just to the west side of Russell County to get earlier warnings but it wouldn’t fit in the five slots. Just another two slots and I could have been able to get warnings before they got close to Russell County. Maybe in the future additions be able to use NOAA S.A.M.E codes directly. That way you can get warnings about your entire county and not just a single city.","5"
"11","FEMA","All say the same - wind advisory. There’s no disaster… except the number of notifications 🙄  —- Previous Review —-  The app that cries wolf  For many days, this app’s been issuing an excessive heat warning for San Francisco. Well, yesterday, I was in San Francisco and it was 56°F midday. The previous 5-10 days, I was in San Jose (45 minutes away), and it barely broke 80°F and was very cool overnight. Not exactly excessive heat weather anywhere in the area as far as I could tell.  So, I opened the app. Turns out the warning is for Saturday and Sunday of the coming weekend, but the notification makes it sound like it’s happening every day. I don’t find that useful.   What could this app have done instead? Follow NWS Bay Area on Twitter. Here is the outstandingly clear and simple statement that the National Weather Service provided in Twitter:  “*Excessive Heat Warning* for inland portions of the Bay Area and Central Coast this weekend. Look for inland temperatures in the 90s up to 110. Coastal areas should reach the  70s and 80s. Stay hydrated and take cooling breaks if you're spending time outdoors!”  😍😍😍  Perfect! I would have completely understood FEMA’s notification if it was this clear and accurate. As it is, I’m now skeptical of any notification this app issues. Please consider changing how you word your notifications.","1"
"12","FEMA","It’s 11:40am as I write this. So far today, since midnight, I have received _98_ (yes, ninety eight) copies of the same exact notification, about an air quality warning for the area. It’s the exact same text in all cases. It’s an important message, but it’s not in the same category as “your city is on fire, evacuate now” or anything like that.  If an app that is supposed to be there to give you actual important safety alerts, instead constantly harasses you with useless / duplicate messages, it’s not only annoying, it’s training you to ignore any warnings from the app, meaning you’re much less likely to pay attention to the app when there actually is a real emergency. That makes the app WORSE THAN USELESS. It’s FEMA being “the boy who cried wolf”.  Fix the app or expect a whole lot of people to delete the app and leave bad reviews.","1"
"13","FEMA","Only add/ change main location, the other 5 locations that I have can only be deleted now, I what to keep track of more then one location, I want to add to the list. The info should have a link to a map. I got a evacuation warning today for a fire, no street name or town, just “oak valley zone 704 & 708 to be evacuated because of fire”. I could not even copy text to paste into maps to find this area. A test feature would be nice that can be set once a month. Another problem, just got a missing person alert and says ‘details at’ then a link you can Not click and can Not copy and paste.  They fixed the copy and paste so you can see info in a browser but still No clicking on link to take you to info and no detail info imbedded.","1"
"14","FEMA","Hello developers - I am a meteorologist and had been recommending this app to all of my friends for robust and reliable weather alerting. Everything about it was great. Within the last couple of months, I stopped getting alerts. I asked around, and several friends are having the same issue. We are all on various newer iPhones. I tried turning notifications on and off, alerts worked once, then quit again. I tried deleting and resetting my location, got one set of alerts, and it quit again. The alerts are there if I open the app, but no notifications are received. I am now deleting and reinstalling the app, to see if that helps, but I’m nervous about having recommended this to so many people.","2"
"15","FEMA","To have a sanctioned government app dedicated to serious emergencies this app should STILL be 50% better!!! It’s improved vastly but I still get notifications that result in ZERO activity… and like last/older version when I open notification there’s NOTHING there to see/read! On flip side I get multiple notifications of exact same thing- bam, bam, bam- up to 5 notifications with/in 5 seconds- then nothing. And the notifications say null about what the notification was for! Seriously- if you want to be an actual FEMA app that exceeds, or at least is on same level as all my other weather (I have 4) plus my apple notifications then you really need to step up!!!","2"
"16","FEMA","I downloaded a similar app a year or so ago (Red Cross - Emergency) thinking it would be perfect to monitor weather conditions etc. for people who don’t listen to the radio or have a television service. It turned out to be no good at all (maybe they’ve fixed it) and I deleted it immediately. It wouldn’t register tornadoes that were happening in my town, or anything else for that matter.   Sitting on my porch today I heard a neighbor’s radio broadcast an emergency message. I looked on the App Store, downloaded the FEMA app, and entered my location. Not even a second after I hit save, the app gave me three warnings in my area that had just been posted minutes before. The information was clear and understandable, and in real time.   Thanks FEMA (and the developers), you got it right with this app.   I gave 4-stars instead of 5, as I think it would be nice to have a map feature showing affected areas. It does however give detailed descriptions of the affected areas, but others might prefer a map.","4"
"17","FEMA","Love the app, very happy to have discovered it.   But what happens if someone presses the Call 9-1-1 button? It has an icon suggesting it is a menu option leading to another page, but it's also a different color than all the others. Does pushing that menu item immediately dial 911, and if so, why? I can't think of a situation that I would opt to do this in this app instead of dialing 911 or asking Siri  Please consider moving, or removing, the 911 button. It is right next to the settings button. Other than that this app is fantastic","4"
"18","FEMA","The FEMA app I used a couple of years ago worked just fine. Like so many things these days it wasn't broken, but they fixed it. The new app tries to do too many things. For me the most important function is the severe weather alerts. The app is just not dependable and has crashed several times when I needed it most. I hope FEMA does a better job at disaster relief than it does building and designing apps.  UPDATE:  I am sitting here in North Florida in Aug., 2023 watching a tropical storm develop into a Cat 3 hurricane in the next two days.  I have yet to receive any notification from this piece of garbage FEMA app.  FEMA or DHS needs to hire a 14 year old to fix this app.  FEMA is absolutely pitiful!  I'm going to delete the app.  Over and out!!!","1"
"19","FEMA","I find this app to be indispensable! I’m not always around my weather radio. In those cases, as well as other similar situations, this app becomes the best way to be alerted to severe weather. One area for improvement would be to have a version for Apple Watch! I’m hearing impaired, and I use my watch’s haptics for alerts. My phone isn’t as good at alerting me as my watch is. I do get alerts on my Apple Watch, but I must have my iPhone with me at all times for it to work. There’s no app for Watch OS.","5"
"20","FEMA","UPDATE: i’m lowering my rating by one more star as excessive notifications continue and I’ve had to turn them off.  Original review:  This app and its notifications are better than nothing. But I worry that people tune the notifications out if they’re getting bombarded with too many notifications, particularly relatively minor updates on already notified issues. My perception is I will sometimes get three or four notifications of basically the same particular weather warning. Maybe some of the details have changed, but I’m not sure it’s worth pushing out another notification.","2"
"21","FEMA","I like the idea of getting alerts for emergencies, such as evacuations and the like, but I don’t need a “winter weather” or “red flag” warning notification for my selected location (every day, this time of year) plus three other counties surrounding. Especially when I have purposefully un-selected these minor notifications. It’s also frustrating that I see the notification badge, but when I open the app I have no idea which notifications are new and which were existing. I’m going to look for another app that will give me the emergency notifications and then get rid of this one.","3"
"22","FEMA","Since this latest update three days ago I’m not getting the alerts on my phone, it’s showing I have 2 new alerts but it’s only giving me an option to add or delete a new location and none of that works, it’s showing it was updated for the iPhone X? I can’t even edit or add a location, have deleted and reinstalled this app three times. Before the update I would have given it 5 stars. I see now that it’s for iPhones 9 or later, why is that? I have a 7 and I’ve always gotten the alerts but now I don’t get them!","3"
"23","FEMA","Update: I rarely write reviews but felt it was important for FEMA to understand the implications of notification fatigue. I’m upgrading the rating from three to four stars since they acknowledged the issue and are working to address it. This is a rarity among app developers. Feeling optimistic and grateful.   FYI: the alerts are currently incessant. I am receiving the same freeze warning alert every one to two minutes. Please fix this soon, so we don’t get desensitized to the alerts and miss something important. Thanks.","4"
"24","FEMA","The app works. Alerts are timely. But after you read the alert, even if you follow the link all the way and press “close,” the it still shows the 1 in the red circle as if you have one unread message.  It also seems to repeat the same alert several times with the heat alerts we’ve been having recently. I don’t know if FEMA is really reissuing them or if the app (or the FEMA computer system) is just repeating them.  So it’s useful, but a little annoying.","4"
"25","FEMA","My Family and I downloaded the FEMA App on our I-Phones & I-Pad.  We’ve benefited from FEMA’s timely advance warnings about potential disasters, with recommended steps to take, depending on severity.  From tornadoes to freezing weather to hail & severe thunderstorms, the FEMA App has provided us with timely advance notice, along with recommended preparation.  Many thanks to FEMA for developing this disaster warning App.  Highly recommended!","5"
"26","FEMA","I continue to get minute by minute notifications spam for winter weather alerts at the first sign of an issue. App version 3.0.12 iOS 13 pro max   This happened during the last winter weather warning. I don’t think I had any custom settings configured. Just the base app using my location.   I have to disable alerts because I get hundreds of them in rapid succession when there’s a sudden weather event. It goes on for the entire duration of the event.","3"
"27","FEMA","I had to turn off alerts, which is the biggest point of the app, because it harasses me with frequent repeats of the same alerts over and over and over every few minutes, eg when a thunderstorm is in a town miles away and heading farther away. Tried to put up with it for a long time but finally couldnt take it any more. Im assuming there was some slight difference in the notices, but im not going to read them all. Im sure no one will. The app or server should recognize that it already sent essentially the same message. This is the kind of thing computers do so easily, filter out duplicate data. But this just lazily passes it on.","1"
"28","FEMA","I have received the same 2 alerts, with no changes to the information within the alerts, 14 times in less than 15 minutes.  I know my area is under a heat alert and that there is a hurricane coming our way - so there will be wind.  The NWS has issued a wind advisory earlier today.  As I am written this the alerts keep coming.  Unless there is a significant change in the information within the alert, why do you feel it necessary to spam the message.   Additionally, your upgrade leaves a lot to be desired.  Your app is going to be introduced to the delete function.","1"
"29","FEMA","But jfc the number of notifications and alerts is blowing up my phone! Minute by minute changes are being sent and there’s no way to reduce the sheer number you receive- it’s either on or off. Many of these notifications are duplicative, and becomes aggravating after a few weeks. I want to love the app, but the notifications just kills it for me.","4"
"30","FEMA","I'm in Florida waiting for Hurricane Ian to arrive, and for over an hour I've been receiving the same text alerts repeatedly. They aren't updates, they're just the same alerts repeated over and over. I finally turned off sound notifications so I can get some work done. If your app is so buggy that people have to mute notifications, it's not going to be as useful as it could be.","3"
"31","FEMA","We have severe storms moving thru, yet this app isn’t giving me ANY notifications. I see an update was done in May so why is it not working when I need it to??  July 24, 2023 Received your msg. I am a certified storm spotter and I am involved with my local ema and do receive the alerts sent out to the local ema app, along with 3 other wx apps.  However, I rely 100% on this app for multiple locations across my state, to send out pertinent wx info and 1 location in MS and 1 location in CA.   Sure hope y’all can get this fixed quickly!! By the time WEA goes off on our phones in Alabama, not much time to react-devastating tornado already on the ground. Many people rely on your alerts, to have as much time as possible to seek shelter. Your alerts come out 2-6mins faster than our local tv news stations/NWS; the local news stations do not send out Special Wx Statements, we rely on those alerts from your app.","1"
"32","FEMA","I love this app, it's fantastic for receiving weather alerts. And yes, sometimes the alerts are a little overzealous (I really don't need dense fog alerts every morning. It's fall. It happens.) But that's not really that big of an issue. The biggest issue is when I have to put in my locations every few weeks. I don't even update the app, it just decides every couple weeks to delete the locations I've put in a dozen times before!","4"
"33","FEMA","Even after the most recent update I am still just getting alerts and then nothing shows in the app at all. Very frustrating because this is the only app that steadily was reliable for years and now it isn’t :(  EDIT: after the most recent update, all of my issues mentioned above have been resolved and the app works great!","5"
"34","FEMA","I’ve received a few alerts and it seems to work well. I especially like how there’s also additional resources on what to do in cases of emergencies.  There is one thing i would suggest, to be able to look at past alerts, when I saw the ones i got they disappeared after viewing them twice. Might have been the warning ending though","4"
"35","FEMA","I find this app to be very important and useful, but I feel like the notification sound should be unique and more similar to the WEA sound I would get on my iPhone. At the moment it is simply to quiet and easy to ignore because it sounds like all the other push notifications I would get. Even the Red Cross app has its own sound and I think this is something you should consider. Thanks","4"
"36","FEMA","In the last week I’ve had two separate alerts, one weather related the other for law enforcement, get stuck in a notification cycle (banner pops up every 1-2 minutes). This continued even after the alert was updated or expired. It continued after turning off notifications too. Waiting to see if there is an update before downloading again.","2"
"37","FEMA","The boy who cried, “Wolf” Push notifications are coming at a rate of 1 every 10 seconds for rather unimportant situations like Wind in LA. Freeze in NY. It’s not like it’s a tornado which pop up out of nowhere and the information is vitally important.  I see a developer reply from 5 weeks ago stating the problem was identified. Identified is very different from fixed. It’s still not fixed! Just one more reason we’ve lost faith in the abilities of Federal agencies to meet their mission.  As of now I’ll have to turn off the Notifications until it’s fixed.","1"
"38","FEMA","I finally had to delete the FEMA app from my phone. In one day - and for one event (a freeze warning in our area) - I must have received a dozen push notifications from the app. I tried to change the frequency in the app but was not able to select something that would work for me. Until this app offers more control over notifications - or begins sending them out more judiciously in the first place - I’m afraid it’s a one and done for me with the FEMA app. Ridiculous.","1"
"39","FEMA","Not only does this ap send notifications ALL the time that are mostly useless, it also loses your set location most of the time.  Almost every time I open the ap it makes me enter my location again. Which doesn't seem very helpful if ever there were an actual emergency situation.  Also, the locations it allows you to choose from are so general and cover a large area I get notifications for winter advisories happening in the mountain 50miles away!  Worst emergency ap ever!","2"
"40","FEMA","My wife and I installed this app on our phones so that we could get overnight alerts in the event of a tornado watch or warning. The app fails to give alerts! We only get alerts when we open the app. We’ve double- and triple-checked our notification settings in the app and in our phones’ general settings, and everything should be working fine. But it’s not.  This is a critical feature of this app. And the Washington Post’s Capitol Weather Gang frequently recommends installing the app to get overnight weather alerts. But clearly the app isn’t a reliable failsafe.","1"
"41","FEMA","I love the FEMA app and think it helps keep me safe. But this new version is driving me nuts! It indicates there is a new alert when there isn’t. When I click on the app to get a new alert if often says “something went wrong.” Fortunately I have discovered the alert is there I just have to go to the home page to find it. Annoying.","3"
"42","FEMA","Got this for local notifications, but the app never shuts up. It says I have 6 notifications I check and it’s the same 6 notifications I’ve reviewed 8-10 times in the same day, with no way to delete them. Most of the notifications are not even for my area, but areas miles away. I’ve tried changing the settings, but it’s still pinging me all day long and eating up my text limit. I want to stay informed, but I’ll be deleting the app.","1"
"43","FEMA","The website is excellent on information to what do in case of an actual emergency situation. The only bug this app has is logging into the website to register and check status is malifunction. Wish they could also update who to call for tech support for this issue. Help!","4"
"44","FEMA","I’ve recently downloaded this app and am missing many alerts because I feel I am constantly having to put in my location information every couple days. I have seen where there was a “bug fix” on this, but I am not seeing the fix. Developers?  Anybody listening?   I put in my location yesterday AGAIN, and then had to do it again this morning.","3"
"45","FEMA","There is a bad storm in the area, and every 4 mins or so this app is sending push notifications. No updated information. Time window for severe weather warnings is unchanged. Just constant zombie notifications. I want to be notified of an imminent tornado, not that the flood watch is still in effect for the next 6 hours just like it was 4 minutes ago and 4 minutes prior to that...","3"
"46","FEMA","I receive updates for wind advisories and snow storm watches over and over—the same notification, but I get like 50 of them in the course of a couple of hours.  If it was something that changed in the warnings, I could understand, but this may cause me to just delete the app.  I think the purpose is valuable, so I really hope they fix this to only send notifications when they change or actually update something.","1"
"47","FEMA","Love the app as I appreciate knowing about threats. BUT it sends 45 notifications for each alert! Even when I’ve read the alert and dismiss it, more notifications arrive. This will cause people to turn off notifications and possibly miss an important alert.","3"
"48","FEMA","I am a retired Firefighter/EMT/CERT I/C.  I really like the Apps 'Reminders.'  If one Life is Saved by using the Reminders, its 'Job well done.' I believe the bug that caused some users to re-enter their location information has been fixed.  In the nine months I have used this App, I have not had any problems. Keep up the good work FEMA.","5"
"49","FEMA","I get reminders on smoke alarms and batteries and preparedness plans. They say to open app to check off if you have done it or to stop receiving. Can’t find where to do this. So every month I get reminded again. Seems like every two weeks. I don’t want to stop all notifications from my phone system because bad weather etc. Alerts are important to receive, but this is just crazy to keep being reminded about smoke alarms etc. Help.","1"
"50","FEMA","This app used to be (mostly) fine, I would have to re-enter locations occasionally, maybe once a month. Now it’s doing it nearly every time I get a notification and open the app. Then when you enter the location, it doesn’t show the alert because it was previously issued. Really, really annoying. From reading reviews here, I’m definitely not the only one with this problem.","2"
"51","FEMA","If ever there was an issue that called for an app, it’s timely notification of emergencies. But this app is so bad, you’ll end up turning off its notifications or deleting it, rendering it useless. Ex: if the temperature is possibly going to dip below 32, you’ll receive more notifications in one evening than you have fingers. And after the umpteenth interruption to tell you it might freeze, you’re certain to show the app just one of those fingers. Really FEMA, do better.","1"
"52","FEMA","The information and resources available in this interface is helpful especially when you don’t have access to WiFi. Much better UX in the latest software update.","5"
"53","FEMA","So impressed with this particular alert system. I wasn’t even aware this app had this capability. In Earthquake prone areas, I consider this a must have. It’s not a matter of “if” it’s a matter of when. Seconds can make a difference.","5"
"54","FEMA","Great resource tool to add to one’s preparedness arsenal. Obviously not a one stop shop and wouldn’t be useful if all connectivity went down, but early warnings are designed to help you get out of harm’s way BEFORE networks go down.","5"
"55","FEMA","I like that I set the locations vs it following me like so many weather and other apps want to, also can determine business and family locations to monitor this way. -1 only for the lack of a share button to copy, email or iMessage the alert text to others.","4"
"56","FEMA","The new and more modern design makes using the app so much more efficient and user/friendly! The app isn’t too busy and has all the vital links I need ready to easily access.","5"
"57","FEMA","The app often has useful alerts but a big issue for me is the app icon will have that little number showing there is a message or alert, but when I open the app, it is nowhere to be found. Or I have to open each city to find it. Wish when the red number flag pops up, it would open right to that message. So I tend to ignore them which is not helping me.","2"
"58","FEMA","I found this app to be more reliable than the weather app on my iPhone when it comes to notifications about severe weather. I’ve been happy with the interface so far and highly recommend using this app!","4"
"59","FEMA","Currently in the path of Irma, app states no active alerts/warnings for my area and surrounding areas. I've received a few banner notifications about hazardous weather, but when clicked the app once again states no alert for my area. I have my location as well as several others near by entered in the app.   I do like the option to add reminders  for smoke detector testing, battery changes, etc.","2"
"60","FEMA","In the previous version there was an emergency item checklist, monthly fire alarm testing reminder,   And fire escape plan which were very, but unfortunately they were all removed in the latest version.  The latest version has been stripped down to only having weather alerts and contact information for FEMA.","2"
"61","FEMA","The old location issues seem fixed. I wish the notifications could be less verbose, main details only: Tornado Watch until 8pm, Thunderstorm, etc. then if you want more detail that could appear in app. Especially true for Apple Watch notifications.","3"
"62","FEMA","The latest version wiped out my configured locations for alerts and I can’t add any back in. Further, the “new styling” appears to have made the back button completely unstyled on my iPhone 8 Plus.","5"
"63","FEMA","Its nice being able to set alerts for multiple areas; I've set alerts for my location as well as my son's work and home since they're 60 miles apart.","5"
"64","FEMA","I use the app for weather alerts and when it works it’s great. Some time ago the app stopped saving my locations and hence stopped sending me severe weather alert notifications. I wrote FEMA, they said they are aware of the problem and were working on it. Months later, it’s still not fixed. Several days of severe weather have passed and no alerts. Why should I trust FEMA to have a working app? I’m acting like severe weather is an emergency or something. :)","1"
"65","FEMA","This new update is so jam packed with information … it’s way cool! I think they thought of everything that could happen to a person, family or pet, and then figured out how to create a concise, accurate and trustworthy article or checklist.    I started downloading checklists so I could use them myself, and send them to family/friends, but it’s just so much info!!  Very easy to search, read, download.  It’s now my go-to emergency situation app!","5"
"66","FEMA","So we’re in the middle of the worst wildfires in Oregon history and this FEMA app sends out an alert about a new evacuation. It includes a short URL to a map. So I click it. Nothing happens. Huh? They sent it out as text only, not a hyperlink. If you want to actually see the evac zone you have to fumble with your thumbs to select, copy and paste the url into a browser. Gee, that’s really easy in an emergency!","2"
"67","FEMA","I noted a problem with the alert badge inside the app and the developers got back to me right away with a method for fixing the symptoms on my instance (deleted and reset the main location). Hopefully they’ll squash the general bug too.","4"
"68","FEMA","Just worked with new App that provides the latest warnings as promised.  Unlike the earlier version, the visual screen warning does not disappear once warning is viewed. I attempted technical support about this issue and only found a pre-programed QA section.","3"
"69","FEMA","App has been sending alerts, but when I open to see them there is nothing. Today I got over 6 flood alerts, non came up when I opened the app. Same thing happened a few days ago, I deleted then reinstalled the app, worked for a day and the same problem reoccurred. Locations were added multiple times but still the problem exists.","2"
"70","FEMA","Something happened to the app with the most recent iOS update I loaded today.  There was a formatting error in the top left when ALERTS are opened. None of my 5 locations were present. There was the option to choose locations but those wouldn’t move to next which was grayed out. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling it but the same issue occurs. I use this for work so 😣 something has happened.","1"
"71","FEMA","I don’t have the time for the crazy repeats of alerts. I had to use the silence feature but that will only be for 24 hours and it still sends the notifications (it just doesn’t alert audibly and vibrate by design)  The app or data source needs more work to be viable. Otherwise it’s just a pain and I don’t feel it’s really useful.","1"
"72","FEMA","The recent update is a big step backwards. There is lots that I don’t care about but it gets in the way.  The worse is that I get repeated alerts for the same storm warning. And when I read the alert, the flag on app icon still says that there is a new alert. How do I clear the alert status?","2"
"73","FEMA","Nice app but need to fix the notifications.  They are like a machine gun of notifications repeatedly for the same event. Like today’s freeze warnings. After losing count of how many times I got the same alert, I turned off notifications, which is unfortunate.","3"
"74","FEMA","The app sends weather alerts for my county and for other counties that I do not want to see. Alerts are repetitive. If the watch has been superseded by a warning the app shows them both. If the warning is updated I still see the old one","3"
"75","FEMA","Currently it is alerting for things I have turned off.  App also shows there are 211 alerts when there are only 2.  Should have done more QA!  This is kind of important.","4"
"76","FEMA","I don’t need the same notification 50 times in a day. I am not a exaggerating… it notified me 50 times between 5:30pm to 7:30pm for a freeze warning. I forgot that I uninstalled this app because of this. I’d rather not have the info than be blasted with it twice a minute every 10 minutes.","2"
"77","FEMA","Every week I receive dozens of notifications telling me to replace smoke detector batteries,  practice fire escapes, etc. I turn them all off they’re back the next week. I receive no notification for severe storms or other emergencies. On Apple’s App Store Preview website for the app are links to the developers’ website and app support both of which 404.  Running ver 2.11.3 and iOS 14.6","1"
"78","FEMA","I have relied on this app for a long time, but the most recent update broke it on my iPhone 8 Plus. Fortunately the app on my iPad still works, but I’m usually closer to my phone. 😢","5"
"79","FEMA","Very informative app - wish it had alerts through it for the things that we subscribe to  - like the township does. If there’s a disaster in our area we should get an alert through the App ! Very informative 🙏🏼","4"
"80","FEMA","I’m currently in the cone for a hurricane. I’ve gotten more than THIRTY notifications in the last hour alone, most of them in the space of 10 minutes, and when I open them, they all say they’re expired and there are no warnings for my area. What use is an app that drowns me in notifications for problems that it then pretends don’t exist? Uninstalling.","1"
"81","FEMA","Why won’t the notification go away on my phone? You totally screwed up a perfectly working app, thanks!  Further review I figured out my issue, but I still like the old app better.","3"
"82","FEMA","The app is a useful combination of weather and emergency info. The rating would’ve been higher except the app has reset the terms and locations about 6 times within the last 8 weeks. That annoyance should be fixed it users will just start to delete the app and stop using it.","2"
"83","FEMA","Terrible storms in the Washington, DC-area last week. My FEMA app suddenly did not work. Completely failed. I came here and thought I’d see other comments about too. Utterly disappointed. I’ve just uninstalled, reinstalled. Fingers crossed but will look for options. Still, I’d prefer this app.","2"
"84","FEMA","Europe, Russia, China and other countries have prepared for the unthinkable by providing shelters and bunkers for their population. Meanwhile, in the US our tax dollars have paid for nothing of the sort. Instead we’re provided an agency that creates applications that teaches us that having reserve water and some food would be a good idea. Maybe have a crank/solar radio. What a joke. Just in time for the second Cold War.","1"
"85","FEMA","It’s handy to get the updates sent to my phone, but they need to have a time stamp on them and need to have a refresh button. Our state is being ravaged by wildfires and the information is constantly changing, it’s hard to know what’s current.","3"
"86","FEMA","In Alaska I have the location set for mat-su valley but I keep getting alerts for the entire state. It’s getting very annoying as there is always an alert somewhere. It goes off several times a day for something 500 miles away.","3"
"87","FEMA","This app was great to have last night as tornadoes touched down in Ohio several times. I was asleep and didn’t hear the sirens. This app was loud. It’s great to be able to tell the app which alerts I want. Great job.","5"
"88","FEMA","I’ve received 20 notifications over the last 3 hours for the same freeze warning near Pittsburgh, PA.  One was helpful.  19 more are a tremendous distraction in 3 hours.  That’s a notification every 9 minutes on average!","3"
"89","FEMA","Preferably the screen brightness adjusts automatically with bright background for after sunrise access and Dark Mode for after sunset access. The screen brightness is currently too bright when viewing night time alerts","3"
"90","FEMA","Since the latest update, my locations were deleted. There are also no alerts although I keep getting the pop up notifications and the app icon indicates the there are x number of alerts.","3"
"91","FEMA","i mean, it's really helpful. only problem I've had is that it'll send you the same notification twelve times w this update. very very annoying and has woken me up. good for blizzard warnings tho","4"
"92","FEMA","I find this app to be really glitchy. This is probably the fourth time I’ve deleted it and re-downloaded it. I’ll open the app and it’s just blank with no data and will remain that way.","3"
"93","FEMA","The fema app is one of my top favs. Today I got a red flag warning and a high wind watch and it told me what to do and when etc.i love this app. But the gci alerts app was horrible it didn’t show me an alert. FEMA is the best.","5"
"94","FEMA","This latest update has cleared all city and state alerts and isn’t allowing any new entries. I hope there will be a fix for this soon.","5"
"95","FEMA","Every 5 mins the same alerts keep popping up over and over. This did not used to happen. It seems to be a bug. The app is not as good as it used to be with the newer versions.","2"
"96","FEMA","For access to this information. Wish there was a list I could download and laminate.","5"
"97","FEMA","Alerts are provided for weather related emergencies for the county I live in as well surrounding counties.... Everyone should download this app and use.","5"
"98","FEMA","The latest update to this app from two days ago renders the app unusable. All of the locations that I have programmed for alerts are gone from the app and the app will not allow me to add them back.   Please fix the problems in this absolute I can add the locations back and use the app again.","2"
"99","FEMA","When you select the city and county you want alerts for you get to select all the alerts you want to receive, for example for Madison county I have only tornado warnings selected but I get any alerts issued pushed into notifications like special weather statements even though I ONLY have TORNADO WARNINGs selected.","2"
"100","FEMA","Okay app, but loses location settings (and ToU agreement) with each update. App icon badge needlessly persists when warnings expire or are cancelled.  Months after writing the above, still no fix for losing locations. Worse: it no longer takes an app update to lose saved locations.","2"
"101","FEMA","For several days, I’ve periodically received notifications that there are Alerts on the app, but when I select it nothing is there. This is not the first time it has happened either.","3"
"102","FEMA","What you did in the new update is causing my app to not load or receive alerts. All it says is sorry something went wrong please check your internet connection or try again later. I know my internet is working just fine it’s this app that doesn’t work.","1"
"103","FEMA","This app works to some extent, but mostly get late or non existent push notifications that when clicked on open the app to no active alerts.  It's now a nuisance and getting deleted. Kind of worked for hurricane Irma, but Twitter notifications from NWS work better alongside the built in alerts for Tornado warnings and such.","2"
"104","FEMA","Developers - please recognize that people need simple but effective information from FEMA.  Developing a button that says “call 911” is pretty ridiculous don’t you think?  With the recent pandemic the public is looking for data and numbers around natural disasters.  What’s being asked for and what’s being provided.  This is all meant to be constructive- not simply critical.","1"
"105","FEMA","Easily recommendable app for anyone in the U.S. The only current issue with it is that the Weather Alert Locations keep resetting, so you have to continually re-enter your locations to get notifications sent to you.","3"
"106","FEMA","The app works fine. It’s a little simplistic, but it doesn’t crash.   The problem is the content. Too many alerts. WAaaaaay too many.    The app serves an important purpose, but the alerts are annoying and I’ll turn them off unless you can find a way of throttling them.","2"
"107","FEMA","Not sure what you did in the last update but all I get is a blank page! Says I have 9 alerts but non show up. With TS Nicole on her way, I really would love to get to the alerts while a passenger in the car. PLEASE FIX ASAP!!!!","3"
"108","FEMA","As others have indicated, locations were erased and unable to be re-entered. There’s a constant notification badge although there are NO actual notifications. Why is your “Response from the Developer” to another recent reviewer, listed as a “one year ago” when the most recent update (2 days ago) seems to be the issue??","1"
"109","FEMA","So I downloaded this app because Hurricane Irma is within days of my location.  I put in my location for home in Collier County and also where I evacuated Marion County.  Allowed access in my settings.  Checked for weather alerts.....NO WEATHER alerts or notices!!! Really?  If I could not give it a star/rating I would.  I don't need a reminder to change the batteries in my smoke detector.","1"
"110","FEMA","I get the same alert over and over. Also get too many alerts because the app gives alerts within a 200 mile radius. 50 or 75 miles would be enough.","2"
"111","FEMA","It’s a basic weather alerting app. No frills. Please change the sound to something different. It sounds like everything else and can been confusing. Thank you","4"
"112","FEMA","Current update (6/22) won’t download for IPad Mini 4, ver 15.5     I deleted and reinstalled app. New ver downloaded and last update downloaded without issue.","4"
"113","FEMA","Great app, newly updated, lots of helpful features and much easier to use. The old version was super clunky","5"
"114","FEMA","There is no info on the update I get the notification but now the locations are missing and won’t let me add any","5"
"115","FEMA","The most basic information that thus app needs to provide you with information is your address or location. I am unable to enter my city and location by every route that is provided by the app.  Please fix this so I can get some use out of this app!","1"
"116","FEMA","This app is inexcusably poorly designed. The UI is horrible, the feature set nearly nonexistent. I was getting multiple alerts a day for weather conditions that would not affect me, because I could only scope it to my county, not my city.  Moreover, I can get the same alerts (except only those relevant to me) with any one of the popular weather apps.","1"
"117","FEMA","Works as well as the government. Imagine getting the exact same notification for HOURS, every two minutes on an insignificant weather event, even after deleting the location.","2"
"118","FEMA","Couldn’t get the latest update to stay updated. Called tech support and man told me to delete the app. When I told him I live in New Orleans and like to know when hurricanes are coming he just hung up. Is there a less than one star rating? H  Acted like he was there to earn money without doing any work.","1"
"119","FEMA","I set up notification about places where my family members live, restricted to just evacuation type alerts. And yet this app sends me every random weather related issue. I don’t care about heavy fog, I care about volcanoes and earthquakes. Pleas fix!","2"
"120","FEMA","The update is full of inaccurate information. Warnings show up in cities that are miles apart. Warnings displayed do not apply do not apply to that city. Example, Portland warnings are tagged in the city of Salem and the are no warnings for Salem and they have many right now. I liked the old platform. It was more accurate","1"
"121","FEMA","I see there isn’t an option that tells the App your location from the GPS in your phone. Will this be added in a later version? I use WeatherBug and it uses my GPS. Thanks.","3"
"122","FEMA","It is nice to receive timely alerts but this app does alert slamming sending multiple alerts only minutes apart. This gets annoying quickly.","3"
"123","FEMA","Love the idea but getting tired of alerts for areas eaat of me and outside of my vicinity. I have location services turned on, therefore it should do a better job. Hoping the updated app corrects this.","2"
"124","FEMA","I get a visual alert from the app on my Home Screen but when I open the app there are no alerts and no locations selected even though I had previously loaded locations. When I attempt to “Add new location”, which is supposed to provide a drop down list, nothing happens.","1"
"125","FEMA","Why couldn’t you keep the managed locations from the old version?","3"
"126","FEMA","This app is so helpful and useful, especially its emergency safety tips. This app helped me prepare for future events, and I 100% recommend downloading this app.","5"
"127","FEMA","For those who’s app no longer functioned after the update earlier this week — uninstall it then reinstall. Worked for me.","4"
"128","FEMA","App icon shows there is something needing attention via a red alert circle with a 1 in it.  It won’t clear and there are no alerts.  Everything was searched in the app.  Annoying.","2"
"129","FEMA","I would give app a negative 100% if that option was available.  Having used the FEMA app with very positive experiences for years (flood, hurricane, freeze and other severe weather alerts), the so-called new improved app update July, 2022 is the worst FEMA disaster!  Definitely another example of government dumbing down!","1"
"130","FEMA","Very informative and useful app. Gives you up to 5 different locations to get alerts for. Works excellent!","5"
"131","FEMA","App isn’t allowing scroll function on alerts.","4"
"132","FEMA","If a weather event is life threatening, it’s worth more than one alert... but we’re talking four alerts about light snowfall during winter. For the same storm, I probably get an average of a DOZEN alerts. Half of them contain the EXACT SAME INFORMATION with a shift in likely end time by... an hour? Please update this to make it worth having this app.","1"
"133","FEMA","After the update today, the app appears to have list my locations and is stuck in some sort of a loop whenI try and add them back again.","3"
"134","FEMA","Like many of the previous reviewers, I receive duplicate notifications for warnings, such as flood warnings.  This should be an easy fix.","4"
"135","FEMA","Literally need this for my job but the app only gives pop ups and if I click on them it takes me to a blank screen. Pretty pointless and I work in emergency management. I hope they fix it. This is a needed app and needed info.","1"
"136","FEMA","We had a heat advisory for 4 days, it said from 8/16 to 8/19 and EVERYDAY there were 1-2 notifications. Once I dismiss it, you do not need to resend it. I'm turning off notifications until it can be fixed or customized.","2"
"137","FEMA","I get notifications and go to alerts but no message with the alert shows up. Instead I get the add an alert page which also does not work. You type in the city and state and click next and nothing happens. This just started two days ago.","1"
"138","FEMA","Lately I get notifications about weather alerts and I open the app to find it blank. It’s now 00:06 hrs and I just got 7 alerts (the same one) for a red flag warning that expired 3 hours ago.","2"
"139","FEMA","The app says consistently that there are no alerts for my area even when the National weather service issues them.","2"
"140","FEMA","The only thing I use this app for is weather notifications. A pretty basic feature of any app. For some reason l, and I don’t know if it’s the app or FEMA itself, they can’t seem to just send one notification. It’s annoying getting 10 winter weather warnings in 15 seconds. Just send one!!","1"
"141","FEMA","Not working at all since last update, the update erased all five of my locations and will not let new locations be entered","3"
"142","FEMA","One concern. Is the ADD feature limited? I think the option to add more places disappeared on my IPhone version.","5"
"143","FEMA","I appreciate the early notifications so that I can locate safe shelter before a possible tornado. - signed former resident of Limon, Colorado. Tornado of 1990","5"
"144","FEMA","There are three watches and warnings available for my area, but the app, once it opens, goes blank and doesn’t respond to anything.","3"
"145","FEMA","It’s raining in Socal and I’ve received alerts all day long for flood watch?  I get it…it’s raining and I need to watch for water!  Alerts are an issue! Too many and you just start ignoring them.","2"
"146","FEMA","Would be great if you could monitor current location.","3"
"147","FEMA","I don’t know how it works. I like the old version. My question is how does it come up with alerts and where a thunderstorm comes or a tornado. Please bring the old version back or change a design to make it easier.   Thanks.   Sincerely, Katherine - The Animal Lover","1"
"148","FEMA","I have to keep reentering my locations every couple days it keeps kicking them out. I really like the app but that’s a pain in the ...  It will get a five if it wasn’t for that.","3"
"149","FEMA","I really like the app but for 1 thing. Every time there is an update, I have to go in and re choose my locations.","3"
"150","FEMA","Hello -   I rely heavily on this app.  Thank you so much for the information.  However, I have been receiving up to four notifications - all indicating the same thing for one location. I am informed every 30 minutes.  Why does this keep happening?  Please advise.  Thank you! L R","4"
"151","FEMA","Prefer the lean concise to the point version of this app. This latest version seems to have exploded with extraneous superfluous flakey bloatware cuteness. May eventually remove if I can find a more professional functional app.","1"
"152","FEMA","It keeps sending weather advisories for my area alerting me of approaching winter weather with 3 feet of snow. However, it’s been super mild outside. None of my other weather apps are reporting winter weather 🤔","2"
"153","FEMA","For an app that represents an agency for those in need… it is rather clunky. Must submit quite a bit of personal info just to get info to see if you qualify to submit your info.  Typical government entity!!!","2"
"154","FEMA","Not bad when it worked. You can go to the PDFs and download plans and kits but it randomly stopped working reached out to them and no real response","3"
"155","FEMA","Since the bug fix update I don’t get any notifications! I have checked all the settings and everything is set properly. Frustrating!","1"
"156","FEMA","This app stinks. Don’t rely on it for weather warnings. Our tax money is paying for it so so guess we are all suckers. Get a weather radio for your home and away from home carry a AM portable radio to keep up with weather emergencies.","1"
"157","FEMA","As of today, I'm no longer able to add locations. What's up? I use this app a great deal of the time.","3"
"158","FEMA","Setting locations: I picked North Carolina, but when I went to select 'city,' there was NO CHARLOTTE (the largest city in the state) in the list!!   Functionality is OK if a little cumbersome and unsophisticated. Data needs a good review and proofing!","3"
"159","FEMA","Very poorly designed app that constantly gives warnings (in the middle of the night) of beach tide dangers!  Come on!  Change this or people will learn to ignore these warnings!","3"
"160","FEMA","I received multiple (maybe 10) notifications with the time of 405am for same special weather statement - today , starting early this morning.  Please fix. Just needs a tweaking otherwise excellent app.  Special Weather Statement issued March 23 at 4:05AM EDT by NWS Gray ME","1"
"161","FEMA","I use this app often but it suddenly quit working a couple days ago.","3"
"162","FEMA","Far too many trivial alert updates, and each one issued three times for a single location!? Just makes you insensitive to the alerts and removes most of the value of the app.","1"
"163","FEMA","Black screen when I try to access the app. I get too many (4 or more) of the same notifications. But then I can’t see the info in the app.","2"
"164","FEMA","I am in Hillsboro county in Florida with Irma bearing down.  All tv stations are running news and alerts round the clock.  I am not worried though; my FEMA app says no weather alerts... Someone please give them a call to let them know a hurricane is coming?  I think they missed it.  Thanks","1"
"165","FEMA","I'm receiving weather warnings and watches from every app except this one... There is literally a category 3 hurricane coming my direction and according to this app, I have absolutely no alerts for my area. 100% useless for emergencies.","1"
"166","FEMA","The latest bug fix broke the Alerts section. A weather alert will show in notifications but the App still shows zero alerts. That makes this app completely useless.","1"
"167","FEMA","New update is horrible. Too glitchy. Basically a larger font and overall decrease in quality. I deleted it when I couldn’t stand it anymore.","1"
"168","FEMA","Very hard to delete alerts after reading them. Toke this app out of my cell and going to stay with The Weather Channel on local TV The old app was much easier to use","1"
"169","FEMA","Presidential alerts? No Thank You. And yet I can’t opt out. Why? I prefer credible sources of  information. “... a friend of the mogul-turned-politico once told her Mr Trump would “lie to you about what time of day it is, just for the practice”. That from his friend. 🤦🏼‍♀️","2"
"170","FEMA","After entering locations for warning the app freezes so one cannot return to any other option/screen","2"
"171","FEMA","Were in a middle of a winter storm and at first it kept sending old notifications repeatedly, not it wont send any. Broken !","2"
"172","FEMA","Please stop issuing alerts in triplicate.  It is annoying enough that I have turned off the notifications for this app.","2"
"173","FEMA","We were told by our bosses to download this app, was working fine and then there was a update. My icon shows 6 alerts yet all of my places for those alerts are gone.","1"
"174","FEMA","This update deleted the locations I have for notifications. It also deleted all of my notification preferences.","1"
"175","FEMA","FEMA, you might want to put some more shelters on your list so América could plan!! Get your act together! Americans are counting on shelters and other information to use in an emergency. This app is no help…..","1"

"177","FEMA","Ever sense I got hit by Harvey I wanted to protect my self even more so I got this app","5"
"178","FEMA","I do like the flash flood warnings but really don’t need a million high surf warnings. I don’t venture near the ocean so this is a useless warning. A tsunami, now that would be a fema worthy alert. I think this app should have alert options otherwise it is a boy who cries wolf.","1"
"179","FEMA","The latest update broke everything - hoping it gets fixed and up and running again soon.  Really stinks that it won’t work anymore on my iPhone 7","1"
"180","FEMA","I received repeated wind warnings for Lake Tahoe at 2:30am this morning which woke me. Obviously the app needs to be fixed!!  I have turned off notifications, which makes the FEMA app of no consequence to me now.  GET THE BUG FIXED!!!!!","1"
"181","FEMA","Alerts can’t be looked at in the app anymore.","3"
"182","FEMA","CONS: To many red notifications, but none available when app is opened.  When notifications are posted it is sometimes provided in a government/airline all points bulletin style— a lot of repeated or distracting info.  PROs: color coded drop downs (alert, prepare, mitigate, resources) are nice when relevant info is given or an actual notification is available.","2"
"183","FEMA","Pending the hurricane, I Kept getting 9 alerts per single update.  It was so annoying!  Info in the app seems useful, but not enough for being bombarded with alerts for no reason.","1"
"184","FEMA","Alerts are coming thru but when u open it up there is no alerts showing have uninstalled and reinstalled still nothing","1"
"185","FEMA","App used to be very good.  However it doesn’t work at all on an iPhone X after today’s update described as being designed for iPhone X.  Email about this is unanswered.  State I live in is under a state of emergency.","1"

Today it's high winds and fire alerts, literally every five minutes. Yesterday it was beach and wind alerts all day long. I've already gotten 3 alerts in the time it's taken me to write this review out.   I know I can turn notifications off, but I do want to know when there are warnings. I guess I'm going to have to just turn it off and hope I notice the badge alerts instead, because this is maddening.","3"
"242","FEMA","so bad","1"
"243","FEMA","FEMA CAN CONTROL THE WEATHER STAY WOKE.","1"
"244","FEMA","When I was younger, I worked for years as a volunteer EMT & firefighter. What I can factually tell you is the time to prepare for a disaster or the unthinkable. Is before the imaginable event occurs because in an emergency the golden hour begins, and any opportunity  to plan is nullified. Because the FEMA app is gov sponsored there aren't any advertisers trying to sell me zombie survival kits but in the event a zombie attack a Myan apocalypse occurs or even something like a hurricane or tornado pops up, this app not only allows me to plan before hand, it gives me shelter locations based on where I'm at, ore disaster planning tips, and any app that increases my and my family chance of survival even by a small percentage us worth it. On the event of am emergency I want all the information I can possibly receive. The government  gas a bad habit or whizzing away millions of our tax dollars but in this case they've used my tax money hoe something I can actually use and something I as well as my family benefits from. The app does what it says bit more importantly when a disaster or catastrophic event happens it will increase my family's chance of pulling through and making it out alive. That in its own gives it 5 stars.","5"
"245","FEMA","I discovered this application while looking for a replacement to the now discontinued weather alert USA application. This is a very simple app however when it comes to the task of providing severe weather alerts I can say the notifications are almost instantaneous. A lot of times the alert arrives on my phone within about 30–60 seconds of being heard on my Weather Radio. This app does not have GPS functionality however you can set up to five locations. Each location is set by selecting your state and county. For voiceover users I have been able to navigate this application with no issues. So far the only thing I can find that I would like to see changed is that the application uses the standard default Apple notification sound. Considering the types of alerts this program is providing it would definitely be better to have its own dedicated sound instead of the default. Otherwise this is an excellent app and I can definitely recommend it.","5"
"246","FEMA","This is by far the best weather app for localized warnings and watches. With a home and a cabin, this app has helped immensely. There are times it has not, however. When issuing app updates, or when a user updates/changes mobile devices, the app should not revert to an 'unused' mode. Most users will not reselect locations in their devices each time and, thus, will miss a critical warning. In the end, the value of this app rests with the user's cognition to update the app every couple weeks, when this responsibility should really rest with the developers of an emergency app. Still, if programmed correctly by the user, this is the fastest connection to warning information beyond live local media. Final note - the app needs a function to override a phone's 'sleep/silence' function to be a true warning tool.","4"
"247","FEMA","BrandonHix from the comment above, you're my hero. Instead of focusing on fun things like fema apps, it'd be way cooler to see better organized support right now here in nj. Rationing is nothing to really applaud; fast and effective ground work would be better. Outside of there being a neighborly helping hand, you can think of Fema as an individual guy packed with having a big load of responsibilty with only limited resources - maybe that's putting it pretty kindly. It's a group of course - in the grand scheme of the number of other ready and willing volunteers (who shoudn't be denied to help because of non-union status btw). Slow stuff. And totally, it comes down to local help and efficiency, and being ready for yourself in tough times as prep. No federal aid dependency recovery junk; their hand isn't that strong nor lastingly effective to be a stable long term help. Also, I'm glad we had firewood for our fireplace when power went out.","1"
"248","FEMA","A multi-billion dollar agency should be able to put out a usable site. For example, it says for nuclear fallout take shelter where the walls and ceiling can keep out radiation.  Well what are the best materials?  How thick? Is brick best?  Wood?  Concrete?  How about some detail?  They say for us to find out what fallout shelters are available in our areas. How about FEMA collecting and sharing that information on an interactive map like Googlemaps?  There are so many great apps out there produced for next to nothing but this huge agency puts out something so basic for a set of problems that are so important to get right.  I'll bet they waste huge amounts of money on internal meetings that are worthless when it could be put into a great app. Just shut this do nothing agency down.","1"
"249","FEMA","It's mainly basics, however something is much more than nothing. Nicely clean cut. To anyone complaining there isn't much validity, honestly FEMA runs out of money annually and it's one of the few agencies that isn't given a blank check.  For improvement: move links to app, add more detail, and add push functions. If data is flooding a network, provide the data automatically whenever possible instead of requiring user input. Push could give heads up notifications as well if it's supplied with your location.","5"
"250","FEMA","As another review mentioned, the app routinely deletes my saved locations and I have to re-add them. I only save two counties so it's not too bad, but I shouldn't have to do that.   Apart from that, basic or not it gives me the local weather alerts as fast or faster than other apps. It's simple and basic but I get the alerts as soon as they are issued. When the locations are saved that is. ;-)","3"
"251","FEMA","This app is very useful and welcome, but sometimes there are so many alerts and notifications that it becomes tedious. For example, today we have high winds and high fire danger in our area, and the app sent out almost a dozen notifications in less than an hour of both of these dangers - some of them duplicated multiple times. I still value the information, but I wish it was a little better written and fleshed out.","4"
"252","FEMA","This is the best app ever, I just love it when my government taxes me and spends the money developing apps that geotag my location in case of an emergency. This app is definitely not a huge waste of taxpayers money. FEMA did the best job ever in Katrina, remember? So you might as well download the app right now and save the NSA a little time tracking your every movement. Privacy is way overrated anyway.","5"
"253","FEMA","I use this app to track severe weather and flood advisories during hurricane season.  This app delivers notifications before all other apps I downloaded for this same reason, including local weather authorities.  Fast notifications and in-app as well.  Does what I need it to do, with the perk of a simple interface.","5"
"254","FEMA","Weather warnings alert portion is not dependable!  Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.  Updates do not seem to be tested out very well before being released, updates often break it. Now getting badge app icon that always shows 2 alerts even though there are no present alerts for any of the 5 counties I have set. Can not get rid of the badge app icon saying 2. Have had number of problems with the weather alert  portion of this app since it was released. On the verge if deleting the app for good.","1"
"255","FEMA","This app covers a lot of bases for FREE. (Well, okay, we paid for it.) The text for specific disasters feature is nice because you don't have to be actively have a wide band connection open to receive warnings. Text will get the point across until you find a better  connection point or source for recharging your device.","4"
"256","FEMA","Overzealous! Late summer in Los Angeles, we have very low humidity and strong winds.  All adds up to fire hazard in hill country. So, this afternoon, my iPhone went crazy with 10 (yes, 10!) alerts all issued at the same time, advising me of fire danger in the rural areas of this and the neighboring counties. Guess what else?  I COULDN'T DISMISS THESE ALERTS!!  My phone went nuts for at least 10 minutes.  Couldn't even read the alerts because the app kept nagging me about new ones. (Really??  Just do ONE @&#$!! alert, and KEEP IT SHORT!)","2"
"257","FEMA","Great app, but for starts, a GPS functionality is a must. Nowadays with so many people traveling, you should get notified of alerts of where you are for your own safety. With GPS you could try to connect with the NWS radio to provide up to date information.","4"
"258","FEMA","I installed this app so that I could be better prepared for the eventual earthquakes in our community's future. Unfortunately, I keep getting posts about fires in the LA region. I have nothing against those folks and wish them the best but I don't need to be pommelled with their fire notices at every turn.  If the app allowed me to tailor the regions in which I'm interested, I might give it another try.","2"
"259","FEMA","Like other reviews, there's just way too many alerts!!! Some come 3 minutes apart for the same weather issue but in different counties, I listed ONE county in SC but get an alert for just about every county in SC.   I listed a county in Western NC but getting alerts for coastal NC out of Wilmington!   Please fix this issue we are all having. I received nearly 20 alerts for severe storms yesterday, just for my area of Lincoln county NC (never got a rain drop)!","2"
"260","FEMA","It's not the sleekest app ever made but it's very efficient with its space and simple to use. They provide location based alerts. I've received a few and they are easy to read and clear. Great app to have simply for the notifications.","5"
"261","FEMA","I keep getting 3 or 4 notifications a day that seem to be for the same warning. Like 3 “beach hazard statements” in one day and 4 “excessive heat warnings” on that same day. The thing is going off every hour. Having so many notifications means I’m much less likely to pay attention to them.","3"
"262","FEMA","This is all I have ever wanted it of an app. Clean design, does a simple job and does it well. Reminds me when it's time to do those preparation things I don't know how many times I've ignored them. Has the info I need. It's just great!","5"
"263","FEMA","I'm having the same issues with the 2 alerts showing, even though there aren't two alerts to show. I have deleted and reloaded the app, but it still shows the same thing. Ever since the new update happened, it's been glitchy at best.","3"
"264","FEMA","Not sure why the other 2 reviewers say the apps alerts were way off. I had thunderstorms warnings here (Washtenaw county) and it started minutes after I'd warned family members about it. Recommend it.","5"
"265","FEMA","The updated app has two notification notices stuck on the app, with no way to turn them off. At this point, the app is more annoying than helpful and sends out alerts when nothing is happening, and misses events.","3"
"266","FEMA","Love the weather alerts!  I get notified when there are alerts where family and friends live.  Also check smoke alarm reminder is a plus!","5"
"267","FEMA","All of you complainers should be a little more self reliant and proactive. You know you can google 97% of the complaints you made. This app is merely here to enable you with the basics... Ya know the ABC's. Go start a kit and stop complaining.","5"
"268","FEMA","I like the alerts, but the app frequently forgets my locations. It would also be nice if it cleared it's alerts when the weather alert ends, so I don't have the bubble count on the icon when there are no active weather alerts.","3"
"269","FEMA","This is simply just an excellent app. Love the checklists! Awesome location settings too which will give each family member peace of mind. Great central resource for related info during an incident. 5 stars from this Californian household!","5"
"270","FEMA","It would be better to type the counties instead of scrolling, because I live in Texas and scrolling through a lot of counties is not good. Excellent app, every alert arrives at the moment, immediately.","4"
"271","FEMA","I would like this app much better if I didn't have to repeatedly save my information. And repeatedly agreeing to terms. ALL THE TIME. It's the same terms, every single day, every single alert, every single time. Please fix! Thanks in advance.","3"
"272","FEMA","Great app!  Very informative. And for those that are annoyed by smoke alarm reminders:  Tap Prepare -> Set a Reminder  You can turn the reminder off or tap the I tested my smoke alarms button to snooze the reminder.","5"
"273","FEMA","Ignore the rating team below. This app is a good start for anyone going into the survival subject. It's a good source of tips and tricks for new people. The gov can only do so much, it's up to you to survive.","5"
"274","FEMA","Easy to follow and use, good information.  To the point, no fluff.  The ability to check items off the checklist is a bonus.","5"
"275","FEMA","Too many alerts, 5 nine minutes apart for hurricane Matthew for Brunswick Co, NC; Oct 9, 2:00 AM to 2:09 AM (3 were listed as 2:00!!!!!!)! Conditions for a hurricane don't change that fast except in a movie! Similar experience for other weather alerts. And they keep popping up if you don't open them. It's crying wolf so much I ignore it!","2"
"276","FEMA","I downloaded this app for emergency alerts. For the last 3 weeks it alerts me every other day to check the batteries in my smoke alarms. I cannot find a way to make that alert go away so I had to delete the app. Too bad because I like the premise of the app.","2"
"277","FEMA","So this version is really buggy. I cannot in any way get the badge app icon to go away. And this it has a continuous problem from other versions where the badge app says 2 no matter how many notifications there really are. I enjoy this app because it helps me prepare for coming storms but it is starting to get annoying.","1"
"278","FEMA","App keeps telling me I have 2 notifications but I can't clear them out. I know that's kinda silly but it really drives me nuts! Also the notifications went all crazy the other day and kept alerting me over and over again to test my smoke detectors. Love the idea of this app & will definitely reinstall if bugs get fixed.","1"
"279","FEMA","Great one stop app for preparing for an emergency. I'll just have to wait for a legit emergency to see if their notifications work.","5"
"280","FEMA","Good work, FEMA, for seeing the potential on leveraging citizens in gathering disaster data.  Now keep moving forward and expanding the capabilities of GIS and Disaster Relief.","5"
"281","FEMA","Far too frequently notifications for emergencies that are nothing like true emergencies. Just got one for Yolo County that warned of clogged gutters.  Oh no, the humanity. There should be tiers of alerts, true emergencies vs. warnings about slick roads. Tornadoes vs. slick roads.","3"
"282","FEMA","Handy info to have, basic and easy to understand.","5"
"283","FEMA","Older versions of the app were fine, but the current one is issuing several reminders a day to test smoke detectors with no way to disable them. I hate to uninstall it with hurricane season approaching, but it is clearly broken.","2"
"284","FEMA","This has a lot of promise, but, like other reviewers, I've found that every time I open the app I have to re-enter my locations, which seems to defeat the purpose.","2"
"285","FEMA","I don't want to be reminded to check my smoke detectors, check my emergency supply kit, practice safety routes 4 times a day, 7 days a week. I would like a heads up when Mother Nature is not happy and is sending unfavorable weather my way.  This app does not do this, like I thought it would do.","1"
"286","FEMA","Really useful App but it now forces me to re-enter my alert locations every time I want to read them. Older versions would retain the locations.","3"
"287","FEMA","Been receiving double notification. One is plenty.","4"
"288","FEMA","The app is promising. Unfortunately where alerts are concerned, it will not save the locations you want to receive alerts on.","3"
"289","FEMA","Useless app, won't save locations so you have to update them daily. Too many silly alerts asking you to check smoke alarms batteries etc instead of warning us about cat4 hurricanes approaching ! I'm deleting this stupid app","1"
"290","FEMA","I can understand excessive alerts when there's a disaster but getting five, six, seven alerts in the space of a few minutes for heat warnings is a bit much.","2"
"291","FEMA","Have you thought of having the app's alert badge disappear after the alert has expired? The badges linger forever.","3"
"292","FEMA","Downloaded, but as soon as this review is posted, I'm removing app until it will save my location. Warnings won't be helpful otherwise. Waste of time for now.","2"
"293","FEMA","I would like to see it optionally tie back to your local EOC somehow.","4"
"294","FEMA","Like the government's own nature of wasting taxes payers money and time helping no one but themselves , this app is useless. Ask the Sandy victims and back slapping politicians who do nothing at all, like this useless app. The review will only allow me to give it one star. I give it nothing!","1"
"295","FEMA","Most stuff on this app is already known information you can find anywhere from anyone. There's a map view of shelters but it only shows what's in Texas...that's it...like the other 49 states don't have any or something.","1"
"296","FEMA","They did good adding the weather feature!","5"
"297","FEMA","App bounces left and right on iPhone which is super annoying. Also too link centered. What if I don't have Internet access post disaster?","2"
"298","FEMA","Save button will not work when I try to select locations and save button does not work in Agree to Terms","2"

"302","FEMA","Very informative except for the daily reminder to test smoke alarms. Is that really necessary??","4"
"303","FEMA","It's a good app and I like it, but lately the daily smoke alarm test reminder and every few days the emergency kit reminder is very annoying. Maybe time to declare the app.","2"
"304","FEMA","Kept using this during the Hurricane. Crude but works","3"
"305","FEMA","It has the red flag saying I have two alerts and they won't go away! I tried closing the app completely, and deleting the app and reinstalling it. They won't go away!","1"
"306","FEMA","Do I need 7 alerts in half a day to give me heat warnings?! Had to turn off notifications, which is the reason for having the app in the first place!","2"
"307","FEMA","I think it could be a useful app, but it's very glitchy and it sends me notifications that can't be read in their entirety or found in the app. Not worth downloading.","1"
"308","FEMA","Does what it is supposed to do.","4"
"309","FEMA","I just deleted the app because it keeps forgetting my location.  The Red Cross Emergency app works much better.","2"

A few minutes later, I switched to the FEMA app, and as the FEMA app opened, I briefly saw an on-screen alert that “FEMA pasted from YouTube” (pasted from my clipboard!).  I understand how/why that iOS alert works. There’s no way for me to block that clipboard access.  Question is:  Why is the FEMA app sniffing my clipboard without my permission? That is a trust and security concern for me. Attention FEMA app developers: please don’t auto-paste (read and take) my device’s clipboard. Thank you!","3"

"324","FEMA","It doesn't show a map of where the FEMA Camps are located.","1"
"325","FEMA","The most blatant and obvious issue with an app such as this, is that you're assuming that you're going to have a cell phone and/or wifi signal sufficient enough to receive any information on any sort of disaster AFTER it has happened.  What cell phone service that is accessible is generally bogged down with everyone trying to call their loved ones at the same time, which will also render this app completely useless. If you need updates, get a solar powered am radio and look into cell phones that use GIS and satellite technologies...  By FEMA releasing this, it sheds a bit of light at just how brain-dead this completely useless agency is. An app to be used on a device that will not work during a disaster? Good one…  The bottom line is that an educated and prepared populous is ready to act when needed, and we certainly don't need to rely on the Federal Government to tell us something has already happened- heck, they release an app that will never work during a disaster! There's a hurricane or a giant asteroid rocketing toward earth? Great! Your local authorities are all you have ever needed. Stay informed without having your hand held by the Feds. Stock up on what you and your family needs, learn how to be resourceful and learn how to read a map and shoot an azimuth.  After this post in iTunes, this app gets deleted! While this may be a cynically-laced review, I'm simply trying to be frank about an app that is just completely stupid in every way, shape and form. Everyone has the tools they need- and that is your senses and common sense.","1"

"329","FEMA","I chose for the app to use my location to help determine nearest emergency shelters. It gave me Florida, N. Carolina, and S. Carolina. Problem is I’m physically in Norfolk, VA. REALLY??! Worst part is that there’s no option to even manually select a zip code to find an emergency shelter, so it’s stuck in Florida and the Carolinas 🤨","3"
"330","FEMA","The app has been destroyed by the latest update and at a time of the year when extreme weather causes high risks to much of the country!  Do the developers not test their release what-so-ever???    Notifications are received as usual and the icon shows #of alerts, but opening the app shows no details and all locations set within the alerts section have vanished.  There is now zero ability to add alerts as the location lookup page no longer works.  Occasionally buttons appear in wrong places with clips of code instead of text!","1"

Another star added for the personal touch.  .……………..................................................... Some good info to have on hand. Haven’t had long enough to test the warnings and notifications.  My gripe is what some others have said about the nearby shelters. I live in VA and my nearest shelter comes up as SD! And I did allow app to follow me when open. I was also able to put in my zip code and choose my county. So this app still isn’t ready for prime time.","4"
"335","FEMA","I like that you can set alerts for up to 5 county locations. It would be nice to be able to specify cities so that when I'm visiting, I don't have to research what county I'm in. You can set family emergency meeting locations. It would be nice to be able to add the rest of the family communication plan, and to be able to share the information with others. I like that you can turn off the reminder alerts. I like that you can see where the shelters and DSAs are. Maybe should add a little note about why there isn't info on a specific location someone is looking for (frequency and source of data; only active locations shown, etc). It would be great to link to other media like YouTube videos with related content to maximize modes of communication.","5"
"336","FEMA","So the last update deleted all my locations. Add them back get notified of alerts and go to app and the alerts don’t show up at all.   I have used app for about 2 years and now it’s just taking up space. Would like to see it get fixed soon  Edit 6/30/2018 after developer response. Yes that was the version that created the problem. My solution was to stop using it after no response from you or no new update","1"
"337","FEMA","This is something I felt can be very useful.  Currently it us a piece of poop! I’m receiving weather alerts for a different city, that is four hours away (nor in my county or even State). The alerts also come at odd times of the day/night which I understand however, it will ding high wind advisory, ding red flag warning, ding high wind advisory cancelled, ding red flag warning cancelled, ding weather freeze; all in seconds of each other.  I don’t have time to completely read the first message before it’s canceled!  I don’t mind receiving notifications of disasters around the world; but I do mind when the let a toddler send them out!!! That kid is randomly selecting messages!","1"
"338","FEMA","Have had this app for a while, and have generally been happy with it, but now with every update (?), I have to re-enter my location. When I have to do this every day or two, it's just not worth it.My states EMA app posts exactly the same alerts, and I don't have to mess around with locations. Bye bye FEMA.","1"
"339","FEMA","iPhones with larger screens have been out for 2 years, and heading into their 3rd... Can't believe people still can't figure out how to code support for larger screens.  How about getting wtih the times there FEMA?","1"
"340","FEMA","I love this app - it's the best free severe weather app I've used. But the version released April 5, 2016 is crashing on iOS and won't work. I got a notification but can't get to the menu, it's loading. Please fix this.","1"
"341","FEMA","Decent information for the uneducated, very general. Way to reliant on an Internet connection for information. Hello, in a disaster event communication will most likely be down. But the big message is be prepared, don't rely on the government to save your butt. (as it should be).","3"
"1","Earthquake","I appreciate the free version of the USGS phone app. However, the push notification for for earthquakes et al should be free as well (not just the pro version). In fact making it free, I contend, would be the ethical thing to do; public safety is important for all of us. I am a disabled and therefore retiring professor in a small northern CA town. For me, even $2.99 is too much and I know I’m not the only one experiencing financial hardship in this area for one reason or another; there are many of us. Please consider making the push notifications free as well. Again, I really appreciate the free version of the app, u do have; I ask, and would appreciate it if the push notification could be free as well. Thank u for reading and considering this.","5"
"2","Earthquake","This app has potential. Great locating, easy to view when map options are low, tectonic fault only that do define strike/slip or subduction and appears up to date w/i few minutes. Challenges: map a bit too generic needs terrain relief(not aerial) standard illustration like on old maps. The earthquake points could be exaggerated a bit more as to size of quake. Color scheme is lost when adding population density which should be a blue scheme or grey scheme not the same as quakes. All faults, volcanos and hot springs should be noted in map too. Lastly a history button for locations pulled up that either integrates with a site like USGS or even just to a search engine and allow you to chose. This is the free version and I didn’t see any of this advertised for premium so until I see ideas such as these or better I won’t go premium. Cheers","4"
"3","Earthquake","Can’t believe someone would rate any app low when it was free and the “good stuff” is in the paid version. They are all like that unless you get one with “in app” purchases which I hate. I’d rather pay an update fee of $.25 every year considering the work that goes into the app. I only have one complaint...they get earthquake info (it appears to me) from different sources so often it appears like there are two quakes but there is one...unless I’m missing something. Sometimes the notification appears to be in Chinese sometimes in English. Otherwise, this works great on my Watch!! Thanks!    ETA:  This works better and faster than the quake notification system recommended for the California residents.","5"
"4","Earthquake","The app that you get in the basic package works great as long as you are ok with minor earthquakes 6.6 and below on the Standard scale. This is pretty much all I need it for. We don't get anything larger in magnitude here in Colorado, Wyoming, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Kansas, and Utah‼️🙏🏼❤️😃❤️🙏🏼‼️ If we do, I live close enough to the NSGS in Golden Colorado to make the local phone call to find out what happened‼️🙏🏼❤️😃😍😁🙏🏼‼️ If you want to follow the New Madrid or the San Andreas faults where the big ones are predicted, you can't go wrong buying the upgrade packages‼️🙏🏼❤️😃💬🙏🏼‼️ I'm a retired teacher so cost is a factor, but the app programmer did a great job for what I need‼️🙏🏼😃🙏🏼‼️ GOD BLESS AND BE EXCELLENT‼️🙏🏼😃🙏🏼‼️","5"
"5","Earthquake","This is a very good app.  And the price point is reasonable.  But the problem is there are all lot of good earthquake apps with reasonable price points.     What has me on the verge of buying this app is the widget.  None of the other earthquake apps have decent widgets.  This app kind of does.   But the widget needs two things.  First it is limited to country, and there should be a whole world option.  The second problem with the widget is it does not have a small widget available.   On an iPad, medium and large are fine options, but on the smaller iPhone, an even more condensed small widget is needed.  Once those things arrive, this will be a 5 star must purchase.","4"
"6","Earthquake","I live in California and have been using this app to keep up with earthquakes in California AND all around the world.  I am very well aware of the reasons, which I’ve been told, that LA County didn’t get an alert from this app for the 6.2 in Ridgecrest.  I am confused.  I live out of this area yes, but have been receiving information regarding the Indonesia quakes, the Alaska quakes and lots of Russia quakes and I sure don’t live there.   I am still NOT convinced that this app is working to its full potential for us.  It is NOT showing the 7.2 yet either and it’s been at least 20 minutes?  I LOVE this app idea....LOVE looking at the earths map to see all!!   Please keep this available!!!!!!!","5"
"7","Earthquake","I’ve got to say i really love this app. You can do quite a lot in the settings to either limit or expand what sort of events you are notified about. There are so many quakes worldwide every single day, i find it helpful to pick an area for focus and then work my way out from there if i choose to. These and other options in the settings work very well because the app is both nicely organized and and visually appealing. It’s worth paying for the pro version and it’s not a steep price. Under $4.00 last time i looked. 🙂","5"
"8","Earthquake","I first started using this app when I moved to California and started noticing the pictures on the walls of the condo were constantly out of level. I figured it would be cool to know just how often we were experiencing earthquakes. I’ve since moved out of California but like knowing when quakes occur around the globe. The alerts always pop up before I read about the quakes on the news. It would be great if everyone’s phone was linked into the system to give data about local quakes as I’m sure a cellphone could detect such events if it’s left resting on a nightstand.","5"
"9","Earthquake","Really appreciate this seismic monitoring tool. Great app.  I would like it if someone could maybe put some notes periodically to offer brief analysis of spikes, maybe a reason for them. ie how are things in New Zealand? Seems like they're rumbling a lot lately. Or maybe there's a place that totally seeing an uptick since cities are becoming more active. It's great for reliable maps and lists for raw data.  The average person has a little trouble deciphering significant events.  Thanks!","5"
"10","Earthquake","The earthquake data updates rapidly and it is great being able to see the location on a map that can zoom in for details. Being able to view by intensity allows you to choose the content by intensity to only see bigger quakes and you can the choose a lower intensity to the the before and/or after shocks that occurred. Great product!  Highly recommend if you like earthquake data.","5"
"11","Earthquake","I keep track of plate motion and disaster areas, this app gives excellent global circumstance to some information at a glance. I used to live in the Pacific Northwest off the Juan de fuca plate... I’m always waiting for the fault to speak, since it is overdue this is a good way to systematically watch seismic activity without having to carry around a ridiculous amount of computer gear to catch a glance. Keep up the good work my friends stay safe and Rock On !","5"
"12","Earthquake","I’ve had this app a very long time.  I have noticed in the past few months it will indicate a 6.0 or better earthquake occurred somewhere.   I’ll google the location to see if there was any damage and there is no data supporting the Earthquake App.   Most recently (last night) the app indicated there was a 6.1 quake in the state of Washington.     I googled and checked the other earthquake information sites and nothing.  This afternoon the quake data is no longer showing.   This as I stated has happened a few times in the past 12 months.  Makes one wonder where the app is getting its feed from.","2"
"13","Earthquake","I like this app. Satisfies my curiosity and does a good job of displaying information. At this point, I am glad I paid for the Pro features. It is only $2.  But, I was annoyed that the app’s apparent push to upgrade made it impossible to enjoy the app, or maybe that was a hiccup. After I upgraded, it kept insisting I should upgrade. Sending a message to support uncovered a problem with their web form. I never received a reply.  I finally resolved my own issues with this app after updating iOS 11. Now using it with iOS 13. Works well.   If not for the hassles, and lack of support response, I’d give this 5 stars. (I am pretty stingy on star ratings. Five stars needs to be simply top notch, without any major and few if any minor issues.)","5"
"14","Earthquake","For those people who live in under develop region that can’t get your pro version,should get the pro version after all they are the people who happened to live in those areas don’t you all think, just to think just one person in that region gets a push notification can warn hundreds around him or her, think about it guys","5"
"15","Earthquake","I loved this app until I tried to transfer it to my new iPhone. I had bought the pro version on my old iPhone and when I went to install it to my new phone it said I had to rebuy the pro version. I’m kinda at a loss on what to do so any help would be appreciated. Thanks. UPDATE: I heard back from the developer and explained what to do. I’m up and running again. Thank you for getting back to me. This is a great app.","5"
"16","Earthquake","This not only represents the best app for earthquakes and instant updates on location, depth, aftershocks, push notifications for earthquakes in your area, but tsunami risks and warnings. Just flawless. Those who made this app need to be very proud of themselves. I am sure this app has and will continue to save countless lives while keeping communities around the world informed.  Thank you so much to the developers . . .","5"
"17","Earthquake","Don't believe I've ever rated an app, even the ones I really like, but today's the day: Downloaded the free version, only took me a few minutes to realize that the important settings can't be made unless you pay, i.e., Magnitude, how far from my location, can only chose ONE location, for instance my daughter lives in California, I don't but wanted to add hers along with where I live. Don't seem to be able to do that. *Which technically wouldn't need to if the area where one can usually specify how far from where they live, can be added, i.e., Up to 800 miles from my location.   I'm amazed this app is being rated anywhere near as good as it has.","1"
"18","Earthquake","I have been an earthquake follower since my days in California in the 80’s. Even felt one when living in Ohio in the early 70’s! I find this apps 2, 4, 5 seismic choices clarifying. One thing I’ve learned since living in Seattle is that, as long as there are regular, small earthquakes, there is less likely to be a big one. This app is great for watching for that as well as understanding our “Pacific rim of fire”.","5"
"19","Earthquake","First I check the “SoHo” Solar viewing app to check on the sun’s activity and compare it to the earthquake app.  There is almost always a direct connection.      ***Would like improvement to add a new symbol for earthquake with pre and post tremors with quantity and with start time and finish time.***... also, man made or artificial tremor symbol.  Thank you for great customer attention with high level of customer response.","5"
"20","Earthquake","I only got this app so I could see activity of earthquakes all over. I am not seeing ANY local activity and I know we had an earthquake last week. It was small but felt by many. I will be deleting this app and try to find one more inclusive of those earthquakes that are close to me as well as those far away.  It told me if I wanted to see more earthquakes I needed to pay their fee. Really?!! I will find a free one!! Who in their right mind would PAY to see such information? Seriously you want me to pay? Anyone who does pay is stupid beyond belief or has too much money on their hands.","1"
"21","Earthquake","I downloaded app because of very active earthquake activity where I live and there might be danger of a tsunami. So far the notification takes about 40 something minutes to notify about the earthquake. That for me it’s too long. So far that’s the only issue with the app I did purchase the pro version. Overall good app need to minimize the notification time after the earthquake.","5"
"22","Earthquake","I’ve had this for about 2years now, I live in south central Alaska with very active seismic activity locally and on a daily basis statewide.  The speed and accuracy is pretty much spot on to what makes the headlines, (same source I’m sure). Very nice because it covers worldwide as well and can have the notifications settings specific to a region. Highly recommend to keep up to date with seismic activities.","5"
"23","Earthquake","Have tried a lot of these apps. This one seems the most comprehensive. The alert feature is controllable (seismic activity, ringer sound options, volume) and it’s super fast. I live in Southern CA so having an alert that will break through silencer at night seems prudent. I also use My Shake app to do my part in data collection.","5"
"24","Earthquake","I love this app but when alarm goes off it’s not very loud for when you might be sleeping. My volume is u all the way and it’s just a short bleep. Not sure how this would help older hard of hearing people because sound is not alerting like an amber alert is. Maybe change the sound of the alert or make it louder as it sounds like I got mail or a text...  Thank You","5"
"25","Earthquake","Installed several earthquake apps to evaluate them. This one gets a second star because it was one of the first to report a recent earthquake. Otherwise it would be one star because of lack of configuration and filter options. Apparently you have to upgrade to the paid pro version to get those. But from the ads for it even the paid version doesn’t appear to have a tenth of the options available in other, free, apps. Recommend looking elsewhere if you’re not going to buy.","2"
"26","Earthquake","The only thing missing from this great app is the same filters applied to the main app on my iPhone to my Watch: I always see Earthquakes all across the country on my Watch, as opposed to my filtered area on my phone. Due to the amount of activity, it makes the Watch companion app rather useless. Would love to see this minor change!","4"
"27","Earthquake","The app is nice is far is it an historical review it does not give you advance warning when earthquake is coming. It has given me a better feeling for how many earthquakes there are every day. I like the fact that you can set the alert level at a certain strength of earthquake. I only wish living here in California that it could also give advanced warning of an upcoming earthquake.","4"
"28","Earthquake","I couldn’t get push notifications to work but the problem could be my mobile provider.  Otherwise, this is the best app if you’re looking for accurate earthquake activity in your area in and around Peru.  I have 4 different apps installed and this is the only one that aggregates everything properly.","5"
"29","Earthquake","This is one of the best apps I have. Not only because I live in California n can track local instances, but am able to follow world situations. I’m very fascinated by the patterns of geological history that quakes present. Really appreciate this information. Thanks. UPDATE: Well since upgrade, I can’t focus on the area I wanted to...how do I get old version back???","5"
"30","Earthquake","Uncomplicated and to the point.  Not cluttered with unessesary things.  Easy to understand and no difficult terms or prerequisites in order to see whats going on.  No popup ads or annoyances. Perfect for those who are busy yet need to knowright then what is happening.  No interferences whatsoever on my phone. The app that minds its own business and does what it should. No reduculas cost or hidden tricks to scam money.","5"
"31","Earthquake","We really love this app!  We’re not in an active earthquake area, but have friends that are and this app pinpoints, at the time a quake occurs, WHERE it occurs AND it’s MAGNITUDE!     Plus it easily allows you to filter out quakes of less than 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and the like at your choosing!       I highly recommend it!","5"
"32","Earthquake","Great info. Thanks Any way of telling DURATION of each earthquake? DURATION is as important as quake size!!!! Longer the quake DURATION the more damage and loss of life usually occurs!! To say nothing of possible tsunami occurrence!! This is a fantastic program. I’m living in Alaska and Utah areas and truly appreciate knowing what’s transpiring under us in this wonderful old world. Thanks again!","5"
"33","Earthquake","Usually pets or animals will sense a quake. This afternoon the shakes had been quiet since yesterday’s 6+ in central California.  While watching TV my IPad tweeted from this app and in seconds Central California had a 7.1 quake and I was feeling it 200 miles away. It was a 40 second roller that continued to send out all kinds of after shocks that this app monitored.","5"
"34","Earthquake","The thing I like best about this app is how accessible this app is for those of us who are blind or visually impaired. I am glad to be able to know when an earthquake may be happening near family and friends so I can be keeping an eye on them and then able to check to see if they are safe if it is a big earthquake..","5"
"35","Earthquake","This is the best earthquake tracker I've seen so far. Can be set for 2+ or 4+ magnitude. I recommend setting it at 4. One thing to watch if u like to save on data usage. You'll want to turn off notifications when you're away from wifi. It'll rack up data usage really fast. Also has map to show locations of quakes and also tsunami alerts. I recommend this app.","4"
"36","Earthquake","I live in area that is predicted to have a major earthquake. I like being up to date on earthquakes and see where the major and minor fault lines are. I do see the notice on my phone before the news reports it.","5"
"37","Earthquake","With everything happening in Puerto Rico and family & friends living there it keeps me informed enough and sometimes notify some of them that are not in the affected area especially near the coast where tsunami can strike, so is better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it","5"
"38","Earthquake","I just moved to Southern California and wanted an app that I can just look up my city and have an easy, user friendly interface to look at JUST MY CITY. Didn’t seem to be possible with the free app, so I upgraded to the paid app. Same thing. Interesting if you want to see data for the entire world, but fairly dumb if you just want to see it for your location. Also, there were reports of seismic activity in my area this morning by the news, though it isn’t showing up in the app. Overall this was a waste of $3","1"
"39","Earthquake","This app is excellent. In the wake of the recent 7.9 off the coast of Alaska I was able to monitor the aftershocks. Up to 123 as of this post. App gives you tectonic plate locations, the quake location, population density and you can customize the map look along with intensity notification by the U.S. and worldwide. This is a must have app","5"
"40","Earthquake","Very helpful in deciphering the patterns in quakes, so you can predict when a big one is due. Did you know that there are key areas, that when movement occurs there, a very large quake will occur within 24 hours? Figuring out where this big one will occur is the next step.","5"
"41","Earthquake","I have tried dozens of other earthquake apps, but this one simply works the best!  It’s reliable and ALWAYS kicks off alerts depending on what the USER sets them to go off on.  Unmatched quality compared to most other apps. Get it.  Seriously, get it.  You can thank me later. :)","5"
"42","Earthquake","I was using another app for earthquake information and when the 6.4 quake hit in Ridgecrest, my last app didn’t even show it! This one is very timely and I like the fact that you can easily toggle between 2+ and 4+ magnitudes. The other filters work well and are easy to use.","5"
"43","Earthquake","The free version of this app doesn't give you any kind of text or sound earthquake notification, so it doesn't have any utility at all when you most needed, which in my case it was today. That's why I am deleting it today without any regret. The only feature you get with this app is a timeline of the latest earthquakes with location and intensity. Nothing else!!! If you wanna get a free version of an earthquake app that really works when you need, and has a very loud sound notification, I highly recommend Quake Alert.","1"
"44","Earthquake","I just downgraded from 2 stars to 1. I would give it a zero if I could. The customer support link is not functional.  I have features I would like to use but, once again the selection is non responsive.   want to keep an eye on the Juan de Fuca plate off Washington state, USA's north west coast.  It presents the highest danger to where I live.  However, the only choices I have to the are to monitor is either the town I live in (60 mile radius) or the entire North American continent.  The 60 mile radius doesn't cover the Jan de Fuca plate.  North America gives me dozens of irrelevant quakes.","1"
"45","Earthquake","I was in this country for a couple of month could never adjust so I lift this beautiful country. Now I wonder If there is earthquakes to places I want to visit and this greatly helps because I can’t sleep very well if I go to those places. Great app","5"
"46","Earthquake","This is what the USGS used to do and it was great. Now I can’t navigate their website. You should be ashamed of charging extra to put a pin on family. You could make a great amount of money with the advertisers that locating family and friends would bring in.","5"
"47","Earthquake","Why the numbers change? Have you asked that question? From 3.1 to 2.2, if it was reported at a 3.1 it is a 3.1 not a 2.1 minutes after being reported. Why lie to everyone on this? Why?","5"
"48","Earthquake","According to seismologists, Nepal is in the high risk earthquake zone. Within the next eleven years (2033), Nepal is likely to suffer a major earthquake. Therefore as much as possible the government of Nepal needs to awakening programmes lunch for the public to reduce the potential dangers and risk that may occur in the near future.","5"
"49","Earthquake","I paid for the Pro... and nothing special about it. The app doesn’t warn you right away... it’s got like a 10-15 min wait time before it pops up.  Living in Alaska, this app is worthless to me. I use another app, that was 100% free. And literally let’s me know when we have an earthquake, at the time of the earthquake.   Don’t waste your money, because I honestly feel like I was robbed out of my $2.99. This app is seriously worthless.","2"
"50","Earthquake","I keep a close eye on earthquakes and have found this app to be superior to others. I paid for the pro version because it was a one time payment, not a subscription. Thank you.","5"
"51","Earthquake","I enjoy this app. I like knowing when the earth decides to do something we don’t appreciate. The data is instant, and reliable. I recommend this if you are looking for earthquake and tsunami information in real time.","5"
"52","Earthquake","Have many EQ apps on my devices. Live near CA/OR border and watch the activity plus dutchsinse on FB for max warning. This app is one of my favorites. It's important to me that the app uses multiple reporting agencies. The best feature of this app by Nico Tranquilli is EQ's are reported before the info is released before any of the other sources.","5"
"53","Earthquake","I’ve had this app for almost 8 years and it has been accurate and easy to navigate. Very happy with it and highly recommend.","5"
"54","Earthquake","This app is wonderful and amazing. With me being able to know when an earthquake will hit in California, I feel much more safe! And now, when my family and I are at the beach, we will be checking the app for updated events and tsunamis. Thanks you!","5"
"55","Earthquake","I have never said that before and I have other weather sites but tried another earthquake site but not even close to this one. Also something’s toooo dam good!! I highly recommend it!!","5"
"56","Earthquake","This site is so good and gives an accurate account, whereas, in my opinion, other sites are vague in their information. Thank you so much for your website.","5"
"57","Earthquake","Timely updates on EQ’s with more info than you can get from any other source.  Unsure what degree of automated reporting this will provide or whether it would reach anyone if the level is extensive, 8 or 9+.","5"
"58","Earthquake","I refer to this website almost every day.  Since I experienced the Loma Prieta quake in Aptos, October 1989 with thousands of dollars damage to my home.  THANK GOD OUR FAMILY SURVIVED WITHOUT INJURIES, EVEN OUR PETS WERE SAFE! Your application helps me stay informed and less fearful of the current earthquakes.  THANK YOU! California Shaker","5"
"59","Earthquake","Been using this app for the last several years and it’s absolutely incredible. I can’t believe it’s so thorough and able to cover the entire planet in real time so accurately. Worth every cent.","5"
"60","Earthquake","I have notified this app many times they send me alerts for Alaska I live in Fortuna California in Northern California no matter what I say they keep doing that I have a 60 mile radius selected on the app. I’ve already paid for it but I’m very unhappy with it we just had a 6.4 earthquake, I ended up on the floor shot out of my bed my house full of glass and China and everything else. No warning for me.   Nancy Ziehm","2"
"61","Earthquake","The problem of this application is that they use in Spanish the word earthquake and written to 3.5 or less, the reality is different because earthquake is 7.0 or more and they should use tremor when the quantity is less.","5"
"62","Earthquake","Awesome information for a neophyte like myself. I have had this App for 5-plus years. Could not have had better instruction in a classroom, on these types of events around the world.","5"
"63","Earthquake","Since July 4th I bought this application because my previous wasn’t effective like this one. The report right of way and with great accuracy.","5"
"64","Earthquake","It’s sad when these events occur however it shouldn’t take anyone by surprise. They will happen it’s just a matter of when.  That’s why laziness is not an excuse to have a emergency bag ready at all times and a plan. Be diligent ever ready for the unexpected.","5"
"65","Earthquake","Cannot get it to setup at a radius distance. Its by country and no idea how many miles radius in that setting. Just had a shake about 200 miles away and does not appear. But it does on the other 3 i have.","5"
"66","Earthquake","So very great for to seeing fault lines, and to see the small earthquakes helps us understand why our dogs get edgy and upset like two hours before even a small quake.  Very Much liking this for so many reasons. Thank You!!","5"
"67","Earthquake","The major fault of this app which I pay for the pro version is that there is no detailed fault line data. One of the most important features to me. I bought another app which has this info. I will probably delete this app and just use the other one.","3"
"68","Earthquake","I have upgraded this app to pro version where the app price as advertised is not the price required in the phone. $2.99 in App Store. $4.99 in app. Could you give me an explanation? It doesn’t even give me pro features???  Sorry I was rating your companion app volcanos.","3"
"69","Earthquake","Now more than ever, this app keeps us informed. Our business has been afected with the recently earthquake and following tremors. We depend on this app for accurate information and updates on present situations. Thank You!","5"
"70","Earthquake","I wish you could select certain states. I'm only really interested in knowing about Nevada and California. All I can get is my home town and California state capital. It doesn't give you the whole state. This would be a very convenient add to your app. Unfortunately I already paid for it so I'm stuck getting all of the north states. Now my phone will be dinging all the time. Annoying at best!","2"
"71","Earthquake","It take minimum 6 minutes to provide an alert for an earthquake and could take as long as 10 minutes. This happened while I was in a high speed internet area.  But it is cool for checking data after you felt the tremor or earthquake.","3"
"72","Earthquake","This app is not worth buying. The notifications banner would not remove itself from my iPhone7 screen after 5 seconds like it is supposed to and all other apps on my phone do. I had to physically remove it the banner on the first three notifications after downloading. Deleted app immediately after third notification banner was physically removed from phone screen.","1"
"73","Earthquake","A useful app, that would benefit from bring able to set the magnitude threshold higher. There are too many 5.x quakes. I would like to be able to set a threshold of magnitude 6 or 7 as well.","4"
"74","Earthquake","This is a very good app, however it gets 4 stars because the developers are determined to get your location…and there's no real valid reason for this….","4"
"75","Earthquake","Earthquake, my only complaint is that I don’t get quicker notifications. Takes at least 2 minutes to get the information. Come on people an instantaneous notification.","4"
"76","Earthquake","A video was listed about Columbia having a 6.0 and buildings shaking. Vancouver island just off the coast of WA has had over 3 earthquakes above a 6.0 in the last 24 hours and nothing reported. Get your  priorities straight.","5"
"77","Earthquake","I’m confused by this app. I live in coastal Oregon, a tsunami zone, and get notifications for quakes in Italy, California, Alaska, Papua, New Guinea... lol We just had a 2+ earthquake off the coast about 30 mi. away. No notification... nothing...  a little  more important than Papua, New Guinea","5"
"78","Earthquake","I have been using this app for more than 2 years and it constantly keeps getting better.  I love how simple it is and how rarely it crashes. Top quality!","5"
"79","Earthquake","I like the simple clean interface and updates.   Nothing fancy but gets info in timely b manner which is all you want it to do.","5"
"80","Earthquake","Maybe you could update more often In The tsunami page.  Otherwise I appreciate this sight very much","5"
"81","Earthquake","Like being able to see where the world is shaking with this app and always waiting to see  when the big one happens","5"
"82","Earthquake","I have tried many earthquake apps and I consider this one the best! It’s accurate and provides excellent maps and notifications. Also like the distinctive alerts it provides.","5"
"83","Earthquake","I use this app to check on current and short past time events, great interface.   Thank you for your time and effort you put into this app, can you add a filter for depth search, accurate depth or wider range ?","5"
"84","Earthquake","Really enjoy this app after having it for a while you realize the earth is a living breathing thing that flexes. Highly recommend this app!","5"
"85","Earthquake","You can count on this app to report and show where the earthquake epicenter is located and its magnitude. Now if it could only warn you of a pending earthquake I would rate it higher.","5"
"86","Earthquake","For my taste I think that the app should have a sound when a natural phenomenon occurs, that is when an earthquake or Tsunami warning occurs. For everything else it is a formidable application, thank you","5"
"87","Earthquake","I am very pleased with this app always. It always provides timely updates, it does an excellent job, and provides detailed information. It’s what I use for all my earthquake monitoring.","5"
"88","Earthquake","This app shows tectonic plates boundaries which I appreciate to map out trends.  It also have features such as population density and where the nuclear plants are located…..all important features.","5"
"89","Earthquake","I can not change a thing in this app. It is wonderful! It informs you in a couple of seconds about the earthquakes. I would 100% suggest it. Do not hesitate because you not going to regret it!","5"
"90","Earthquake","A few tweaks of this app such as better map /hybrid would boost this app to 5 stars across the board. Other than map it is the best earthquake app on the store. The fault lines disappear above New Zealand as you zoom in.","5"
"91","Earthquake","Since the last Apple update, all the earthquake alerts are remaining on screen, even thou I have accessed the earthquake app. What is going on? I believe the last Apple update created a glitch in the earthquake app.","5"
"92","Earthquake","This app has let me keep track of earthquakes and other people have heard it go off and they immediately download it! Great App!","5"
"93","Earthquake","This application offers more insight to how volcanoes behave . A view of the Ring of fire, tectonic plates, and the magnitude of the volcanoes's eruption, earthquake scenarios, make this application a powerful tool to get an global overview of day to day events, and some tools continue to offer other information - like tsunamis.","4"
"94","Earthquake","I got this app shortly after going through a 7.8 earthquake in Ecuador in 2016. It has proved invaluable to me over time. You will never be the same after going through 54 seconds of pure terror. Get the app.","5"
"95","Earthquake","I am amazed at the ability of this app to collect data and its easy to digest format . Well done!","5"
"96","Earthquake","It takes too long for notifications to pump up and the region is the world instead of the one that I choose","5"
"97","Earthquake","But can you fix it because when i do call with it come earthquake noffication the call will be closed fix it","5"
"98","Earthquake","I wish i could see a list by location —separately and covering past 4-6 months. Especially for US locations.","5"
"99","Earthquake","I am so updated with your notifications, to me is very important to know when an earthquake happens to be ready for the needs of my loves one. I appreciate your work is astonishing.","5"
"100","Earthquake","The app has worked great and has been very helpful. Recently I accidentally bought the pro version and I have been trying to cancel it but I haven’t been able to find how. Can someone please help me?","4"
"101","Earthquake","I love getting the notifications.  you can check the magnitude and see the location. This is amazing. It's scary to see how many earthquakes are happening all over the world. The app works great. I love it.","5"
"102","Earthquake","Why we being asked so many times to write a review? If we gave 5 stars and do not want to write a review don’t ask again, please!","5"
"103","Earthquake","I have had no issues with the program","5"
"104","Earthquake","The best and easiest app to use to follow earthquakes world wide.  My only suggestion is make the power of the quakes more varied, not just 2 and four - I’d like five or six as an option too","5"
"105","Earthquake","I payed for the alerts. Well worth the money. I’m alerted to any quake in the us on one magnitude level set by me, and worldwide on another. It’s awesome if you know anybody outside your town that you care about. Thank you","5"
"106","Earthquake","I look bhgfdddvbbat this daily","5"
"107","Earthquake","I appreciate that this App keeps me accurately informed of seismic activity around the world. I have contacts all over the globe and this data is ALWAYS IMPORTANT.","5"
"108","Earthquake","Highly recommended! Fast, Accurate and reliable info !!!","5"
"109","Earthquake","I live in Oregon and your app shows earthquakes long after it’s happened. It shows earthquakes everywhere else on time though. Doesn’t show what is current. Do you report to USBS? And why don’t you show the ones in Yellowstone?? I’m trying to remain hopeful.","3"
"110","Earthquake","This app is low setting crap. There are less expensive apps with better features in them like being able to select a specific area. By state or mile radius to epicenter.","4"
"111","Earthquake","The warning sounds 20-30 minutes after event. And with a very high T-Mobile signal.  Good for record maintenance","5"
"112","Earthquake","The app seems to work well. I look at it fairly often and would recommend it.","4"
"113","Earthquake","Easy to use and I love the filters.  Really makes you appreciate the technology that goes into monitoring earthquakes.","5"
"114","Earthquake","We live in an earthquake prone area and it’s so much easier to check the quakes on this app than to go to the USGS website. I really like it.","5"
"115","Earthquake","Nice app to have. Can know about an earthquake just about anywhere in the world. Should be a selection to where the notification sound can be changed, or turned off or on by the user.","4"
"116","Earthquake","You can set it to notify you at whatever richter scale you choose, including location. Super fun for earthquake/ geology enthusiasts!","5"
"117","Earthquake","This app was amazing before they did a claimed upgrade but actually made it much less user friendly and now charging for for the claimed pro use. They should take it back to its original format. I used to promote the original version to my classes and now, let’s just say there’s nothing nice to say.","1"
"118","Earthquake","Does what it’s supposed to in a comprehensive manner.  Probably the best laid out EQ app out there. Would love to see another filter or two added for alerts.","5"
"119","Earthquake","Tremendous App, no bug, wirlygigs, nada. Tells it like it is every moment! Have this app on 9 family phones. Very helpful for traveling.","5"
"120","Earthquake","I paid the premium version expecting better performance. We feel the quake, and then get the notification 20 or 30 minutes after the event. What is it useful for then??? I can go on the internet a look for the information in less than 5 minutes.","1"
"121","Earthquake","I like this app because it lets me know within a minute or two of the latest  earthquakes in my area. Which are out of control right now. ( Puerto Rico)","5"
"122","Earthquake","I love this app!  Gives me a variety of great information and is so easy to use and navigate from local to world wide scope!","5"
"123","Earthquake","This app delivers on the promise of keeping one informed of earthquakes in a very timely manner. I love the heat map feature that shows app usage especially after an earthquake.","5"
"124","Earthquake","Not until I got this app I realized how often and which countries are more prone to earthquakes. This app will keep you well informed. My money was well spent. I really like this app.","5"
"125","Earthquake","I really enjoy the app and have set alerts for earthquakes however it would be EXTREMELY beneficial if there was a way to set a tsunami warning as well in the filter/settings.","4"
"126","Earthquake","Like I said I like to know when the big one happens because it’s gonna happen soon you guys keep your chin up!","5"
"127","Earthquake","This site this extremely accurate and a lifesaver. I would like to see activity updates for preparedness.","5"
"128","Earthquake","I’ve been using this site for personal research for a few years. I have found it to be reliable and most useful.","4"
"129","Earthquake","I am really enjoying this application. It is amazing to see just how many earthquakes happen daily worldwide!","5"
"130","Earthquake","I been following the earthquakes in Puerto Rico. My family lives there and is nice to be able to monitor the recent activities.","5"
"131","Earthquake","Enjoy the site. Very fast posting from the actual event. Lets me know where not to move. DFW person","5"
"132","Earthquake","It keeps zooming out instead of in. Or at least have the option of doing so to view the location while reading the article.","4"
"133","Earthquake","Why am I unable to set my filters to one specific location and continue just seeing my set location?  I even paid money to go pro because that allowed filters to be set but they do nothing.   ***DO NOT GO PRO***. You get the same thing without paying money 😡😡","2"
"134","Earthquake","I don't think there was a need for all the additional cities that come with a flat map. The globe was easier to navigate, and even easier to find which cities can be found rather than having a mess of cities showing up all over the place!","1"
"135","Earthquake","Excellent the only thing is I would like the option of a selected country instead of having to write the country every time.","5"
"136","Earthquake","Well designed, very good looking app! Plenty of easily available date. Only thing that could make it better is tsunami alert notifications!","4"
"137","Earthquake","I really like this app and the information is gives. Especially that we also can see the map","5"
"138","Earthquake","My other earthquake map was down yesterday , so I down loaded yours, much better, thank you .","5"
"139","Earthquake","Timely and accurate report. Would like to see duration (seconds) in future updates. Great app!","5"
"140","Earthquake","It’s very interesting to see so many in the world happening. Thank you so much for this app, good job everyone. I gave you all a 5 stars.","5"
"141","Earthquake","Love the way this app presents what’s happening. Settings tell the whole story. One can fine tune your settings so that what you want to know is what you will know.","5"
"142","Earthquake","I downloaded this app last spring when Kilauea started acting up, it’s been an amazing and useful resource for monitoring earthquakes all over the world.","5"
"143","Earthquake","Let me know about the last ojai quake about 30 seconds after I downloaded it.","5"
"144","Earthquake","This app works very well. It notifies you as soon as an earthquake happens. Later, you hear it in the news. Good app to have.","5"
"145","Earthquake","Most timely notices and bedt presentations, have friends in other parts of world and it is great to be able to keep up with their safety; Thank you all. Chris","5"
"146","Earthquake","I have a different app for earthquakes that I don’t have to pay for the “pro” option that lets me pick my own alarm and set it for the range of magnitude. I use this app as a back up I guess.","3"
"147","Earthquake","After I experienced an earthquake in the valley where I live, I thought it advisable to have at my use a means for detecting earthquakes. I have been most satisfied with this app.","4"
"148","Earthquake","Love that I can put my city in. I wish I could have the option to put my state in.","5"
"149","Earthquake","Since I live in earthquake country, I like to see trends that give me a heads up of what’s happening in my area.","5"
"150","Earthquake","It’s a fantastic app to receive updates on earthquakes around the world. Would recommend everyone","5"
"151","Earthquake","My husband has the same app and gets all the alerts I bought the Pro and it never alerts me. And yes I have turned on the alerts","4"
"152","Earthquake","I manage real estate all over North America and this app is terrific! The ability to establish set points in regions, the alerts, tsunami follow up is all spot on! Thanks and keep up the great work!","5"
"153","Earthquake","Able to keep Quick updates on Puerto Rico activity.","5"
"154","Earthquake","The pro version is an in app purchase so you can’t use it with family sharing. Feels like the developer is using it as a petty way of circumventing the App Store policies.","3"
"155","Earthquake","I enjoy having a window of the world  Bring in the pacific n/w this app. Is very informative and a window of what’s happening in my world,","5"
"156","Earthquake","Love this app, needs a “how far is that from me” button added","5"
"157","Earthquake","For example, we had a 4.1 this morning near Antigua Guatemala and 90 minutes later it’s still not showing in the app.   Otherwise an interesting reference app at times.","3"
"158","Earthquake","Its ok but that annoying alert needs some options!!! I cant figure out how to turn it down or off, I'm about to trash this APP after paying for the PRO version!  Seriously.","3"
"159","Earthquake","Currently your app list earthquakes of 5.0 and greater magnitude with a star for all.   Earthquakes at 6.0 and higher need to have their own icon, like a diamond or such.  That would be a great help and much easier to spot them in my research, as I am monitoring the earthquakes in comparison with the Bible and I found that through the past century, there has been an increase in  larger intensity quakes.   Thank you!  Thomas","4"
"160","Earthquake","Easy to understand a great joy to lead my prayers.                  Dr Wiley Tomlinson.  Great app           Makes me aware of many happenings around the world. A world that needs prayers -thanks for making it so easy.               Your servant Wiley Tomlinson","5"
"161","Earthquake","Notifications are very late more than 10 min after insident","5"
"162","Earthquake","This not worth the money. I feel the earthqauke after 30 min or so I get the alert.","5"
"163","Earthquake","Love this app! A lot of details and pretty prompt from the quake happening to when the info is received.","5"
"164","Earthquake","I love this App It’s keeping me up to date to where the earthquakes are hitting.. Keep up the Fantastic job informing all walks of life,  Greetings from USA/Rockford,Michigan","5"
"165","Earthquake","This app is very quick and accurate.","5"
"166","Earthquake","The filtering options are great and keeps me ahead of the news! This is one of my favorite apps","5"
"167","Earthquake","App settings often revert to defaults. When using the app on my Apple Watch, it shows world quakes even though it’s set to a region.   Overall it’s a good app","4"
"168","Earthquake","Great app like how you can change sensitivity easily. Recap on homepage of last 24 hour.","5"
"169","Earthquake","I like this app but many notifications","4"
"170","Earthquake","So helpful all the time of the day. Life changes so fast and this App is always so accurate.","5"
"171","Earthquake","I like you can pick and choose the area where your relatives live. How do you delete the very old earthquakes? Over a month?","4"
"172","Earthquake","This app has informed me at the moment of events around the world.  Keeping me prepared  from earthquakes  in the event of one close to home.","5"
"173","Earthquake","Even more so now that there are so many natural disasters going on. Its nice to be able to keep up to day as they happen..","5"
"174","Earthquake","I’m able to analyze and see within minutes of the event...","5"
"175","Earthquake","I had another earthquake app I preferred to this when I had a Samsung phone and it was free. I opted to pay for this app because it seemed to be the best one in the iPhone App Store. It’s hard to read and not user friendly, in my opinion.","2"
"176","Earthquake","This App gives me helpful information I like it very much. Thank you","5"
"177","Earthquake","Not able to see cities countries states","5"
"178","Earthquake","I think it presents the event a little later than what one expects but it’s still very useful.","5"
"179","Earthquake","Excellent app.   Smooth navigation. Must have during these last days.","5"
"180","Earthquake","Truly amazing! A technical tour-de-force. Accurate data received within 3 mins of quake showing strength, depth, and accurate location.","5"
"181","Earthquake","Has come in very handy since we had the 7.0 earthquake on November 30th. The app updates fairly quickly.","5"
"182","Earthquake","It is very precise ,and practical , having the information right away !!","5"
"183","Earthquake","It well put together, the UI is intuitive and it’s very informative.  There’s a little confusion regarding colors and magnitude/plate boundaries, but that might just be me not understanding the rating algorithm.  Nice work Gang.","4"
"184","Earthquake","Informative apps without any annoying ads.","5"
"185","Earthquake","USGS has a ton of data on its interactive site, but this app gives much better graphics & is not glitchy like the USGS’s.","5"
"186","Earthquake","The best app so far for alerts at home or all over the world.","5"
"187","Earthquake","A lot of times I get notifications about 30 min or more after the earthquake","4"
"188","Earthquake","Nicely designed, user friendly and,well organized.","4"
"189","Earthquake","Easy to use and  has both maps and  textual detail. Shows plate boundaries.","4"
"190","Earthquake","For being Pro and costing $2.99 it is a poor app.  Earthquake notifications are received after more than 30 mins.. Other apps have the same features for free or cheaper cost, notifications sent immediately, and I have validated the data against USGS and they are reliable.","1"
"191","Earthquake","Appreciate the easiness to use and the information it provides very accurate and well done","5"
"192","Earthquake","Please fix “allow Critical Alerts” button in filters. I’m not able to use the button.","4"
"193","Earthquake","Really great app, that you can use to get so much fun information","5"
"194","Earthquake","Love this app. Keeps me updated on what is happening to our earth around the world","5"
"195","Earthquake","My favorite app ever  ,I use this everyday ,great to know where the last earthquake is ,just in case the big one hits","5"
"196","Earthquake","If i could lower the radius to even less, even with the pro version, this app would be great. 5 star no problem, but its not.","4"
"197","Earthquake","I like the idea of having everything in one place earthquakes,Tsunami’s,ect.","5"
"198","Earthquake","I want to select by time interval and sort by magnitude to find events of interest.  Didn’t anybody think of this?","4"
"199","Earthquake","There needs to be a setting in which we set a certain state and county, and it automatically opens to that UNLESS turned off. Specially with an app that we pay money for the upgraded version. Fix it plz","1"
"200","Earthquake","Used to be a good app. Hadn’t used it for awhile. Tried to find info on an earthquake that occurred minutes ago in my area & can no longer search by date or location   Deleting.","1"
"201","Earthquake","Very useful. I keep track how things around the world regarding earthquakes are going on thanks to this very exact app.","5"
"202","Earthquake","This is a great app.  It was even better before they removed the info on the type of plate boundaries (divergent, convergent)","5"
"203","Earthquake","We’ve had 2 earthquakes in Orange County California and i was able to locate them.","5"
"204","Earthquake","Someone should plot the quake loci in 3D so you can see underground where the quake starts. First App I find that shows that will get my money.","5"
"205","Earthquake","This application is the best, ever. I forget when the earthquake happened in Mexico, this application is warning me much earlier, for me it is the best","5"
"206","Earthquake","I love knowing what’s going on in the world, thank you so much. Our world is truly on fire!","5"
"207","Earthquake","I downloaded this app to be able to watch the area. My parents are in. And I have to pay to get any kind of notification. It’s not worth the frustration at the time. I do not recommend this app. I would just suggest the USGS app.","1"
"208","Earthquake","Very useful notification and accuracy.","5"
"209","Earthquake","Yes, I love this app. Living in LA, kinda takes the fear out of the earthquake threats and makes it all more interesting. It is so quick to show what’s recent.","4"
"210","Earthquake","I didn't know much about earthquakes until this app.","5"
"211","Earthquake","I like the app but I have noticed it takes a while for earthquakes to show up. It’s been 25 min that an earthquake happened and it still hasn’t shown up. When it works it’s good.","3"
"212","Earthquake","Keeps me informed as to not only earthquakes but also tsunamis- important since I live on the coast!","5"
"213","Earthquake","I travel all around the US for work and it keeps me informed","5"
"214","Earthquake","Very informative keeping me updated when I am working Overseas. I like the ability to select my locations, severity level of the tremors and alert tones.","4"
"215","Earthquake","I’m very interested in the earth movement. This tool provides all I need.  Thank you","5"
"216","Earthquake","I upgraded to a pro version thinking options would be better but NOPE! Total garbage and waste of money. Always delayed and you can’t filter it for a specific date only. Also, the fault doesn’t show up.","1"
"217","Earthquake","Really terrific for science buffs in general, not to mention those interested in earthquakes.","5"
"218","Earthquake","Makes keeping tabs on what’s happening in our world much easier!!","5"
"219","Earthquake","Really not happy that the first item on the description (push notifications) is not actually available unless you pay.... blatant bait & switch. Will uninstall and NEVER pay for this app, just based on principle. Why not just be upfront and list your limitations in the description?!","1"
"220","Earthquake","Great app, informative but not difficult to use","5"
"221","Earthquake","I can’t live without it","5"
"222","Earthquake","I thought the information would post sooner that 5 minutes. Other apps have immediate posting.","3"
"223","Earthquake","I like this app because I live on the coast. It keeps me updated on earth quakes near me.","5"
"224","Earthquake","I’ve tried them all.  Best EQ app in the app store, hands down.  Highly recommend!","5"
"225","Earthquake","Living in Alaska, I appreciate the fast reporting and the good maps.","5"
"226","Earthquake","It seems more accurate than usgs...","5"
"227","Earthquake","Highly customizable displays with earthquake and tsunami warnings. Well worth the modest price for such useful information.","5"
"228","Earthquake","Earthquake is an easy and quick read to keep abreast of local and world wide occurrences.","5"
"229","Earthquake","I pay for the pro version and I just love the notifications.","5"
"230","Earthquake","Show 6 and up I know it will show up","5"
"231","Earthquake","Had an earthquake here in the bay area did not see it on my phone why","3"
"232","Earthquake","This app has the most informative updates that you need.","5"
"233","Earthquake","Goes down a lot","4"
"234","Earthquake","When satellite image shows up and is brought into view, what you are looking at, the image is canceled out by a digital covering so the image is erased. Most irritating !","3"
"235","Earthquake","The app works well but the notifications are a mess and not intuitive to setup. They also do not group and FAR too many are deemed “critical” pushing other notifications down. I am sorry to have bought the “pro” version.","1"
"236","Earthquake","Nice app. the free part.  Functional.  Looks good, works well enough.  However, I do not believe paying for notifications worth the $1.99  Bob","4"
"237","Earthquake","The number can be misleading if there are different units of measurement used for the earthquakes or no units of measurement at all. How can meaningful comparison be made? Correct this problem and the app becomes useful.","3"
"238","Earthquake","Accurate and I like the maps","5"
"239","Earthquake","You repeat the same thing over and over all day!!!!!!!!","5"
"240","Earthquake","Posts earthquakes hours later and not real time. That’s my only complaint.","3"
"241","Earthquake","Great updates","5"

"243","Earthquake","Love this app very accurate a lot of alerts a lot of details","5"
"244","Earthquake","Live in a high earthquake area. Receive info on quake in minutes.","5"
"245","Earthquake","Nice app. Provides info on earths movements before you hear or read about it in the headlines. Who knew southern Idaho is always in motion?","5"
"246","Earthquake","Great app for seeing where earthquakes are in the world. Keeps me aware of how many there are and the reality of the fault lines.","5"
"247","Earthquake","I liked this app because I can see the earthquakes of the entire world. But honestly, I CONSIDER that THIS APP COULD SAVE LIFES, don't see why people needs to pay for the right to be informed. It is a shame that the ones that have the knowledge to help are mostly looking for money. SHAME!","1"
"248","Earthquake","My daily go to","5"
"249","Earthquake","I love this app.   My only recommendation would be to add in a Wikipedia link to the location.  Cheers!","5"
"250","Earthquake","Really enjoy this app the coverage has been great","5"
"251","Earthquake","Fast, accurate in earthquake alerts.","5"

"255","Earthquake","Love this since the quake last week helps me to know I am not just paranoid","5"
"256","Earthquake","Thought this would be a good app but you are stuck looking at every earthquake in the world and cannot filter to your area unless you purchase the Pro version. Deleting this app.","1"
"257","Earthquake","The best earthquake app by far! Earthquakes, tsunami warnings, maps, and updates with corrected numbers!!","5"
"258","Earthquake","suggestion: add animation to see all the earthquakes for a specific area and time frame.","5"
"259","Earthquake","I like to be aware of where and how bad an Earthquake is! I am always looking for what I consider a trend!","5"

"262","Earthquake","A very good app but sometimes the information is pretty slow but it’s certainly worth watching","3"
"263","Earthquake","It was easier to set my location filters. I get all the specific updates that I want.","3"
"264","Earthquake","It works great, has nice filters, you can set alerts.  Includes tsunami alerts.","5"
"265","Earthquake","Make me with all information in my island","5"
"266","Earthquake","There was an earthquake at 9:21 today. The city alarms went off and this app only notified me at 9:50 which is pointless","3"
"267","Earthquake","This is a cool app. I particularly like the alerts and notifications of earthquakes around the world.","5"
"268","Earthquake","Considering it is life-saving information, costs should be kept to a bare minimum so as many lives as possible can be saved!","2"
"269","Earthquake","Shows earthquakes that the US agency doesn’t report.","5"
"270","Earthquake","Should make ’PRO’ version also for free. You save the people!","5"
"271","Earthquake","The app is well organized and easy to understand","4"
"272","Earthquake","This app provides valuable data on changing dynamics of tectonic plate actions surrounding the Hawaiian Islands.","5"

"274","Earthquake","Enjoying your reports continued please I enjoy them","5"
"275","Earthquake","Excellent app to keep you updated and track earthquakes","5"
"276","Earthquake",">Living in a State (CA) that is prone to Earthquakes;  it is reassuring  to have a  APP that alert me to a large  earthquake  When I am on the road or Freeway !  Thanks !","4"
"277","Earthquake","This is one of the greatest apps I have ever seen. Thank you","5"
"278","Earthquake","Great app if like following seismic activity and want it current.","5"
"279","Earthquake","The alerts arrive ten minutes AFTER the earthquake. Which is, y’know. Useful.","4"

"281","Earthquake","Very informative, accurate with very important information.","5"
"282","Earthquake","This is an outstanding app. Simple to use & a ton of information in real time!","5"
"283","Earthquake","So many earthquakes in the world this app helps","5"
"284","Earthquake","It gives me notifications for places in California that I never even heard of. It gives me notifications that are off way into the Mountains that I don’t care for. Kinda a waste of money even though it wasn’t that much.","1"
"285","Earthquake","I had hoped this app would allow you in settings to chose distance from your location.","2"

"295","Earthquake","Wish there were more filters, but great","5"
"296","Earthquake","Iam glad to have daily aknowledge about earthquakes in globe, thanks for this program really deserve posarive rating.","5"
"297","Earthquake","Great App, but a bogus report was broadcasted last week showing a M 6.5 Earthquake in North Korea in the area of the prior Hydrogen bomb test site. Was this somebody's idea of a joke?","4"
"298","Earthquake","great app but would be better if it can automatically change the filter position and notify me according to my current position","4"
"299","Earthquake","I monitor earthquakes around volcanoes and this app does not report quakes less than 2.0 which is vital for magma movement. Wish I hadn’t purchased Pro version before investigating this.","1"
"300","Earthquake","I expected more views, default settings and functionalities.","4"
"301","Earthquake","I like to know how strong they are! I live in the “zone”","5"
"302","Earthquake","I like the app. Next update should include a notification volume adjuster. It’s so loud.","5"

"312","Earthquake","I thought I liked this app. But just now I read an article that Yellowstone had experienced a swarm of about 91 quakes Thursday. Go to the app, and nothing. Unreliable is all I can assume.","1"
"313","Earthquake","I got this app to notify me of dangerous earthquakes that could harm me. The alarm goes off 30 minutes after the earthquake. I’d be dead by that time. It’s worthless for that purpose. Don’t install.","1"
"314","Earthquake","Very accurate, thank you.","5"
"315","Earthquake","We just went through 2 earthquakes in Mexico city over 6 in magnitude and it didn't report them until much later   For that I read the newspapers. Don't waste your money.","1"

"323","Earthquake","Doesn’t give the depth of the earthquakes! Deep earth quakes are important!","5"

"342","Earthquake","Love this app like to keep up on earthquake activity thanks for the app 👍😄","5"
"343","Earthquake","The world is constantly shaking. What you need is an app that can weed out the noise and alert you of actual events. This does not. Every 2.0 or 4.0 shake is displayed loosing in the mess the actual 6.0+ quakes.","1"

"497","Earthquake","Hi","5"
"498","Earthquake","Good","3"
"499","Earthquake","It’s not free. Liers","1"
"500","Earthquake","This is a nice app but what it really needs is the ability to utilize the iPhone accelerometer to detect earthquakes and share that data to the cloud and/or the USGS.   Only when enough similar readings are detected from a certain region within a narrow timeframe would the data be considered legitimate and then be pushed back out to the map for all users to view.   The app could also be active only at certain times of the day/night that the user defines. As well as only be active when connected to pre-defined wifi networks. Such as Home or work.   Another option would be to only take accelerometer reading when it is plugged into power (such as when on your night stand or connected to a computer USB).   The app could also use the iPhone GPS to disable sensor reading when moving. As well as only record seismic data when the app detects the iPhone is laying flat on its back.   Another option would be to disable the seismic sensor data output when a face is detected with the front facing camera.   Requiring the app to be running in the foreground would also further prevent false readings.   This could easily, quickly, and cheaply create a huge network of seismographs around the world.","2"
"501","Earthquake","I really like this app. It helps me stay informed in a seismically active region. Helps to give me peace of mind in troubled times. The latest upgrade on tsunami reports just helps to make the program that much better. There is one downside. I wish I had more detailed control of the incident parameters. I would also like to overlay the info from both info databases onto the map. Living in PNW I need this data.  Thank you for a great program app. Hope to see it expand and get even better. I hope to be able to incorporate this into my SAR work.","5"
"502","Earthquake","Love it and would rate it 5+ .... yet due to the recent updates, they are now behind on the times that the quakes actually take place in areas once they once were right on target.   I  do highly recommend this app as have several others ,  this is my first choice and usually only one . The recent upgrades do give options sharing information that are great for visuals like myself , looking forward to seeing them fixing the time frame 👍🏻👍🏻","5"
"503","Earthquake","I am very happy with this app, especially since I am in another state and I have family in California so if God forbid some powerful earthquake  happen I know immediately.  I highly recommend this app for people who live out of state but have family in earthquake prone areas that they can stay on top of things and then God for bid if there's an emergency they know immediately.","5"
"504","Earthquake","Earthquakes are happening in more places, and with greater frequency.  This app is a welcome tool for providing important information that will allow you to maintain your situational awareness, and allow more efficient planning and response to hazardous conditions.  This, as well weather radar, are a must have...    Yes, I do recommend this app...  Five out of Five Satrs!","5"
"505","Earthquake","Excellent interface and easy to set by magnitude and region. I have been checking it frequently because I live in Chile and we are still experiencing aftershocks on a daily basis. I notice data on this app gets posted before USGS but sometimes the numbers are a bit different. Also, I notice many double postings for the same event. That can be a bit confusing. If the app developers could eliminate that, it would be perfect.","4"
"506","Earthquake","After using this app for a time, I like the fact that it has a filter that allows screening out earthquakes based on intensity.   This allows the alarms to sound  on only the severe earthquakes if you choose while still being able to revert back to lower intensity if you choose.","5"
"507","Earthquake","Really great app! I'm new to the west coast of the US and am really interested in geology. It's really cool to be alerted to activity and be able to visualize on the map where activity in occurring.   I know it isn't a tsunami app but I wish the app also allowed an alert notification option for tsunami warnings. (not the information alerts that are released but the actually warning alerts to take action.)","4"
"508","Earthquake","Very well done. Good maps; informative text. All the information anyone would require. Well worth getting and keeping. The alerts are very timely; the locations are easily found on maps other than those on the app. Good for notifying friends in the immediate area.","5"
"509","Earthquake","Living in an area that gets a few earthquakes (Los Angeles) I wanted a reliable app that provides notifications and info. I literally tried almost all the apps before getting to this one. Since I started using it it has been extremely consistent and reliable.","5"
"510","Earthquake","This app is very configurable. Lots of data.   Sometimes it appears the same earthquake is listed twice at two locations and from to different sources.  Not certain if there is a difference between the two sources and it is the same earthquake or if they are two separate quakes at the same second.","4"
"511","Earthquake","It has everything.  Setting filters for what you want to see is easy and will not wake you up. The middle of the night.  Only downside is iPhone front page only shows stats for USA and does not seem to be customizable for a filter.","5"
"512","Earthquake","We never new how many earthquakes we have in Montana until our 50 year 5.8 earthquake last week. We found your app & Your app explains the times we have felt the house shake very slightly and had no clue why.  All The quakes in Yellowstone National Park not far away. Thank you","5"
"513","Earthquake","There are wonderful earthquake apps in the Apple world. But the Alert is a big stand out.  There are a few tiny tweaks they should improve upon.  They should add a 5+ button with the ability to turn off the 2+ and view all. M","5"
"514","Earthquake","Earthquake appears to be a solid app with dedicated data collection. Unfortunately, the app allows only two sampling points to kick back toward the user. Having some number around 10 would have given this app a fifth star.","5"
"515","Earthquake","Overall great app. Few suggestions:  1. The gradient list looks dated. 2. Notification filter is limited to two locations.  3. Multiple push notification is sent for same event from different sources.","5"
"516","Earthquake","The creator of this thing needs to cease the psychopathic, continual, annoying nag screen to leave a review!! Otherwise, it's really a convenient and mostly accurate alert. Would be really dope to be able to customize the alert sounds!!","5"
"517","Earthquake","I have been looking for a earthquake app and have been disappointed in some that I've tried this app is the most easiest and most user friendly that I have come across it is well worth the $1.99 I am very satisfied 5 stars!","5"
"518","Earthquake","I like the interface and the feature (push notification) but disappointed with the lack of updates from Nepal. I can understand not taking the time to update it if it was minor but I think people want to know if they are 4 or bigger.","4"
"519","Earthquake","I am an 82-year-old science teacher. I began using NOAA earthquake apps which were simple repeats of the maps no statistics. Now my students can go all the way to the top as a professional seismologist without having to change their toolkit.","5"
"520","Earthquake","It works well enough for a feed app.  Not much expectations: Get and communicate the targeted feeds.  How it could be better?  Expand Custom triggers.   Send alerts with custom info to your colleagues if triggers are tripped.   Expand alerts with to do activities and phone event work flows if triggers are tripped.","5"
"521","Earthquake","I downloaded this app on april 2016 to monitor the Earthquake in my country Nic. Since is a very volcanic land, i like to be informed of every movement that happens Thanks earthquake!! I highly recommend this app to everyone who has their loves ones in a country that has volcanos activity","5"
"522","Earthquake","This app has a clean and intuitive interface. In watching it daily I cannot believe how many quakes occur on earth. But I did not like having to pay $2 dollars for push notifications","5"
"523","Earthquake","Solid app. The markers on the maps could be bigger, and it would be nice to have state-level notifications. Those are the only two (and minor) improvements I can think of.","5"
"524","Earthquake","I love this app. The only issue I have is that it tells me what county the earthquake happened and I have no idea where it was till I open the app and look. The alert would be better if it named the state not just the county.","5"
"525","Earthquake","This app does not give a sound alert. Also had a banner on my phone showing free upgrade but doesn't show where to read about it at","5"
"526","Earthquake","I like knowing about small earthquakes in my area. Explains why my cats are behaving crazy! Never fails. If they are zooming around house, I check my app and it explains it all. Also, I know I am not having dizzy spells. I am sensitive to earthquakes.","5"
"527","Earthquake","We had a minor earthquake, nothing serious, so my first thought was to find an app that could give me some info on what just happened. This did it. Very simple. 👍👍","5"
"528","Earthquake","Accurate and up to date, uses many different data sources, offers more features than most apps and it's very easy to use. Highly recommended.","5"
"529","Earthquake","Excellent app.  Does what it says it will do which unfortunately not all apps do.  With this app you are informed within minutes of any earthquake anywhere in the world and it also provides tsunami warnings.","5"
"530","Earthquake","It's one of the best apps to have if you live near afoult lines it keeps you up to date on quakes arround the area, so far I have no complains about it. It would be great if this app had known fault lines included in the maps.","5"
"531","Earthquake","I was trying to find information on the earthquakes in Ecuador when someone mentioned this app, immediately I downloaded it and the information was instant, thank you!","5"
"532","Earthquake","As far as I can tell. I knew about the Italy quake way before stories hit the news. This morning though it said there was an 8.2 quake near Acapulco. For 30 minutes you could see it on the map and then suddenly it was gone. Now I look stupid for telling local TV people about this app.","3"
"533","Earthquake","Allows you to see quakes down to 2.0 where other apps limit the power end to 4.0 and above. That said, you can't customize the app to open to a map of your location- like others opens to a world wide lost of quakes and you have to switch to map.","3"
"534","Earthquake","I like having a daily, up-to-date notice on seismic activity around the world, but mostly Chile, where I live.  The map view lets me track the activity and study the patterns.","5"
"535","Earthquake","Updates quickly. Accurate information. Very useful if you live in an earthquake-prone region.","5"
"536","Earthquake","This app for earthquakes is fantastic! Better than the other earthquake app out there. The map is easy to get to and the push notifications work all the time.","5"
"537","Earthquake","This app has worked very well for me. It updates with recent earthquakes very quickly. Easy to use and has a nice layout.","5"
"538","Earthquake","I got this to monitor the growing number of earthquakes in Oklahoma.  Quite amazing.  When I first started monitoring, earthquakes were typically 1.8 to 2.3.  Now they are running 3.5 to 4.0.  I wonder what this is going to do to the Ogalala aquifer.","5"
"539","Earthquake","The inside of the weight of the information I received so far is blows my mind how many things are going on over world at one time is mind blowing. Never knew that much earthquakes and fires are happening at once.","4"
"540","Earthquake","Outstanding accuracy and love the alerts. If possible, it would be a nice addition to add some photos or videos. Also, being able to view a quantitative history of a region(s) would be worth paying for. ☺","4"
"541","Earthquake","Very good App it works well with finding earthquakes. I like the GPS navigation on location where you're at. I like how can zoom down to where the epicenter center is located.","5"
"542","Earthquake","I'm addicted to this ap. It's absolutely fascinating to watch the swarms of quakes happen. Seems like you can almost see patterns to it. I love the instant updates when big quakes happen as well.","5"
"543","Earthquake","I've tried several of these. Some have just stopped working. This one is my favorite. It's clear and easy to use and navigate.","5"
"544","Earthquake","Excellent. I'm originally from Peru, so having an app that alerts me when there is an earthquake is very important. My only complaint is one event when there was a drill that was reported as an 8.0 earthquake. Not cool!","5"
"545","Earthquake","The app is great. I agree with another comment on dual announcements with different names but I am not bothered by it as it confirms notices. I used it last week to predict quakes in California and Lower Mexico based on increased activity and a strange quake in Arizona. I love this APP!","5"
"546","Earthquake","The Pro version gives me worldwide realtime coverage, and I can configure it tightly for the West Coast where I live.  Really like the flash banners supplemented by USGS emails for specifics - with links to tsunami reports fairly quickly.","5"
"547","Earthquake","Tried a couple of these apps. This seems to have more data sources and an intuitive, clean interface.","5"
"548","Earthquake","Track the tremors and see which part of the world is rockin and rollin. Great app!  Helpful and important!  Living in earthquake zone makes having this app a great source of where the earth is reacting to our abuse. Wonderful!","5"
"549","Earthquake","Does what it says it will do. Upgrading my review to 5 stars since developer eliminated the annoying vibration that used to go off every time the app was used.","5"
"550","Earthquake","I like this app, however you cannot choose a mile or km radius for your alerts. I don't need or want to know about earthquakes 2000 miles away. Only those closest to me. I can hear about the big one in another state or country by searching.","3"
"551","Earthquake","This app is well designed, but I wonder how useful it would be in a disaster area. Mobile networks go down witin minutes. How  instantaneous are the messages?","5"
"552","Earthquake","For longer than a year, I have enjoyed the Earthquake app.  It truly lends insight to a dangerous global phenomenon that recurs daily.  If we also had an app like this for volcanic eruptions, what insight would that lend!","5"
"553","Earthquake","I like the ability to change multiplayer filters to fit my needs.  Give it a try today!","5"
"554","Earthquake","I might give this app a better review if I had been able to use all of its features. The problem is, I downloaded the lite version to see if I like the app. However, since I can't use a lot of the features in the app, because I wasn't willing to pay for the full version.","2"
"555","Earthquake","Love this app!  All kinds of info worldwide or you can select the area or countries you want to get info about.  Quick and easy!  Very well designed!!  Great App!!!!","5"
"556","Earthquake","Text is too small as I am older and have a vision problem. It would be helpful to have a setting option to increase the text size.  As a result of this situation, I cannot use this app.   Apple apps do not have this problem because they utilize the Accessibility setting for Larger Text.","2"
"557","Earthquake","Work work yesterday installed and we have three 4.1 up north to Phoenix my family not feeling the things I do show my phone and watch to. Free and work","5"
"558","Earthquake","Great app for geology lovers. I personally don't live in any earthquake zone, nor does anyone in my family, however I am a geology major and love the dynamics of plate tectonics. So, either way it's a great app to have.","5"
"559","Earthquake","Tried a bunch of earthquake apps and I'll save you the time. This one is the most detailed, accurate, and least ads.","5"
"560","Earthquake","Change the New event header for something more meaningful, like the intensity (5.3) and City Name. All the important things should be presented first, please! Specially those to be displayed in the notifications panel of the smartphone.","4"
"561","Earthquake","This is a great app to keep up on earthquakes all over the world! I mainly use it to watch over areas where family lives. 😊","5"
"562","Earthquake","It would be nice if ALL apps were as well done and worked as effectively as this one. If you need to know about earthquakes, this is the app for you.","5"
"563","Earthquake","It's accurate and it helps tho, Ecuador had 3 earthquakes at the same time close this is why was so strong but I wish I could click only in that country to keep tracking.","4"
"564","Earthquake","A very useful and informative app. Even though we don't get major tremors in the area I reside, is very useful to have a tool as complete as this one.","5"
"565","Earthquake","Works exactly as advertised. I have used a few other earthquake apps but this one shines above the others.","5"
"566","Earthquake","Not a complicated app but it's interface is clean and it works well. Upgrade for $1.99 allows for notifications. Worth it. Recommended. Cheers!","5"
"567","Earthquake","App is dead simple to use and easily generates notifications for areas I choose.","5"
"568","Earthquake","I haven't had  this program very long but what I have  seen of it.   its a user friendly programs","5"
"569","Earthquake","Use it daily. Fast, accurate information when you need it most.","5"
"570","Earthquake","The only problem I have is there is at least a 10 minute lag time between the event and it showing up on the application.","4"
"571","Earthquake","This apps works well, you can view the map and see where the earthquakes happen, and you can see a list of recent earthquakes. If you want to do anything more, it'll cost you.","3"
"572","Earthquake","This program rocks! Keeps one aware. Look up the images,after,by tapping in coordinates to maps,google and such. Amazing.","5"
"573","Earthquake","Other free versions let you edit at least the size of quakes for notification. This app would send hundreds of notifications. Other apps much better and free.","3"
"574","Earthquake","Great app. Allows you to see where the Earthquakes are on a map and gives historical information as well!","5"
"575","Earthquake","I was overwhelmed by free upgrade to pro version where I can filter by country and see all the events in particular country with push notification!","4"
"576","Earthquake","A very nice app. Easy and highly accurate with dependable information. I will recommend this to all.","5"
"577","Earthquake","I love it! Quick information. Easy to use. Excellent","5"
"578","Earthquake","Love the default features! So far this is the best one I have found! I wish the city default had a 200 mi. radius instead of 60!   Keith in Boston","5"
"579","Earthquake","It shows all the worlds earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred and you can look at earthquakes from the past","5"
"580","Earthquake","I have friends in Japan which has a plethora of earthquakes.  It is satisfying to keep track and know that they are safe.","5"
"581","Earthquake","Since the earth quack I have been using this app to see all the after shocks that we r experiencing I love it","5"
"582","Earthquake","At least this one works!  Another one I had quit working!  This is fast, accurate and informative. Thanks","5"
"583","Earthquake","The USGS web site is hard to use, so I like to keep track of tremors with this handy little tool.","5"
"584","Earthquake","Just what I want to know with perfect amount of filtering out/through areas","5"
"585","Earthquake","Just all around solid, powerful app with a simple, intuitive interface.","5"
"586","Earthquake","It would be five stars for sure if there were the option for more than two notification filters.","3"
"587","Earthquake","You need to to keep your eye on the weather and the earth quakes when you live in Oklahoma. It's my go to app when the ground shakes.","5"
"588","Earthquake","It's so interesting to see the swarms of Earthquakes. It's exhilarating to feel them as long as no one is hurt. Gets your heart going for sure! Love the format of this app.","5"
"589","Earthquake","I went for the Pro version and the Push worked to my specs within a couple of days. I wish this had tsunami info, tho.","4"
"590","Earthquake","I live in Minnesota and have no big geologic concerns regarding earthquakes but find this app fascinating. I can't believe just how active our planet really is. Thanks","5"
"591","Earthquake","Great app for those interested in quakes especially if happening close to where you live!","5"
"592","Earthquake","The app is great EXCEPT for the fact I cannot get any PUSH notifications, UNLESS I pay to get the PAID app. I think this is chicken s--t!!  I have two other earthquake apps on my phone and BOTH of them give me PUSH notifications WITHOUT having to pay for them. I think you guys need to re-evaluate this issue!!","1"
"593","Earthquake","Nice and friendy user interface, multiple filter for custom push notifications, love it","5"
"594","Earthquake","I have downloaded many different Earthquake App, this one won the battle. The best one of all of them.","5"
"595","Earthquake","Love this app, even though it scare me to death !!!  So many In one day world wide.  I never knew there were this many !!!   Scary!","5"
"596","Earthquake","I've tried them all and this remains my must have app in this category.","5"
"597","Earthquake","Enjoy this app. Seems to be accurate based on what we feel!","5"
"598","Earthquake","Really enjoying the program. Am surprised how many there are a day especially Alaska","5"
"599","Earthquake","Looks great, works great even in Japan. The filtering is great and the app itself is beautiful. The sharing function is also awesome!","5"
"600","Earthquake","Would be much more useful if push notification could be set based on distance from epicenter instead of by country.","3"
"601","Earthquake","This is a good app very important to  know the information of a future disaster !!! Highly recommend ...","5"
"602","Earthquake","I find this program to be the bast applications for my needs.  Keep up the good work.","5"
"603","Earthquake","I was able to follow the resent earthquakes in Colombia, with the information of the magnitud, depth and location relative to where I was.","5"
"604","Earthquake","This is a great app. Well thought out. Logical and easy to use!","5"
"605","Earthquake","Seems to be doing the job for my average use of locating recent earthquake list.","5"
"606","Earthquake","Have not had this app very long, but tonight when we felt an earthquake near here, it was very comforting to get some immediate information!","4"
"607","Earthquake","So far it is working very well.","5"
"608","Earthquake","Awesome app! I just wish on the timeline view that I could narrow it down to my city.","4"

"615","Earthquake","I start the day with news headlines, weather , and my earthquake tracker. I do this to stay informed. Oh yeah... the obituaries too.","5"
"616","Earthquake","Easy to use and it can be customized to the area you want to mainly watch.","5"

"624","Earthquake","To many pop ups.  Very annoying.  Understand some but this is ridiculous. Lots of other earthquake apps to choose from.","2"
"625","Earthquake","I down loaded this app because I am curious about all the earthquake activity going on around the world. I am also registered for USGS emails. A large earthquake hit Chili and a 7.7 at that. This app did not even register it and I have it set on world settings. So it's a waste.","1"

"631","Earthquake","Use this all the time in OK now that we have so many earthquakes.","5"
"632","Earthquake","Good App only issue I see is after getting quake info it will not move you to the reporting site","4"

"634","Earthquake","Let's you how big,were and when!","5"
"635","Earthquake","Great app easy to use.  Needs a refresh button.","5"
"636","Earthquake","If you have an interest in knowing about the dynamics of the earth this app is fundamental.","5"

"652","Earthquake","It does what I expect it to do ... notifies me about significant quakes around the world.","5"
"653","Earthquake","Living in Oklahoma's earthquake-prone zone, for us this app is of unique interest, informative and helpful.","5"
"654","Earthquake","Really too bad they did away with notifications on the free version.  Sometimes its locations do not match those of USGS, which is strange.","2"
"655","Earthquake","Not specific enough.  I live in Los Angeles and am subject to endless seismic events. However they lump the whole of Los Angeles as one searched city.  Need to be able to split it up. Tarzana, Encino, Woodland Hills etc...","2"
"656","Earthquake","Very informative and easy to use.","5"
"657","Earthquake","Informative and useful. Should be part of everyones library.","4"
"658","Earthquake","Went to turn on notification and found I need to pay $2 for that feature. Deleting this app now.","1"
"659","Earthquake","There was a 7.8 in Mexico posted on Sept. 19 that was TOTALLY FALSE according to the *USGS*!!! Is that an official enough source?! AND it not like they made a mistake in the number...THERE WAS NO QUAKE AT ALL!! The WORST is they didn't even RETRACT it! VERY UNPROFESSIONAL      I felt so stupid telling the USGS what APP I used to get my info. Won't be TRUSTING it anymore! COME ONE!!!","1"

"669","Earthquake","Piece of crap. Not a single word about quakes in NW Oklahoma & we've had 2 in the last 24 hrs. Both were strong enough to set off burglar alarm. Even bought the Pro upgrade. Not worth even the $1.99","1"
"670","Earthquake","Enjoy keeping up with the earthquake reports","5"
"671","Earthquake","I am in the insurance business and use it to illustrate how pervasive the earthquake exposure is.","5"

"720","Earthquake","Late update or no update. Felt lots of earthquakes in Nepal. However there is no update in the app.","2"
"721","Earthquake","Awesome app!!! Love it. Does everything I want it to but I have a few suggestions for upgrades that can be added into the pro version. Getting push notification in pro version is nice but I feel the need for more features in the pro version. If you could add these features I would be happy to pay much more than $2 for the pro version.  Add more layers to the map.  Layer 1 -- satellite map. That way you can see actual earth terrain under the quake location. This should be an easy pull in from Google. Layer 2 -- add volcanoes! Active and inactive volcanoes layers is important relationship to seismic activity. Add same history feature as earthquakes. Make them red+orange top triangles for active lava volcanoes, red+grey top triangles for active/ash and yellow triangles for inactive/caution and black triangles for dormant. Or make sublayers for each of these types. Add same pop up data window when touch a volcano. Layer 3 --tectonic plate boundaries with names and the direction the plate is moving indicated by arrows at boundaries edge. This would be so helpful to see because most quakes are happening at these boundaries. -- make scrollable slider in left window. List can get really long to scroll with finger. Having a slider bar there can make it much quicker to scroll to bottom by dragging that. -- add ability to choose which databases are showing the data. To get world seismic data you are pulling in many databases. For instance ability to uncheck usgs data or only check usgs data would be nice to see the database differences.","5"

"947","Earthquake","Well I would like to take a break from my walking being a ole man I find my Bones are not what they used to be. So as I set my cane down let me talk about this great unique Outstanding app! I have been using this app for a few years now and I have learned a great deal from it. I am lucky I don’t live in a Earthquake area so to ear the word Earthquake really didn’t mean much to me . Then I got this Unique app and the Developer opened my eyes He coded His software that had to take a great deal of Hard work sweat time and yes love! You can tell this by the many many updates that the Developer has made! His latest update improved the colors of the ocean and land when I opened that last update I totally went “ Wow “ I hope if you took the time to read this you will Download this very Unique Outstanding Design App and really give it try ! Maybe you will learn something also ( I bet you will ! ) Well time for this ole man to get my cane stand up and get these ole Bones moving, but I want to take the time to truly Thank the Developer for such an amazing Unique App! So with that Mr.Developer I Tip my Hat 🎩 to you and Say “ Thanks “","5"

"950","Earthquake","Informative. Great user interface, color and location-magnitude indicators. It is super valuable; I got the Pro version. I have an iPhone 12 screen size.   Two suggestions: First, allow the country and Island text names to be larger for readability; as I zoom in to read the location name because it is too small, the text correspondingly becomes smaller, thereby never getting to see nor read  the larger text name, and at the max zoom the name disappears while the other text names do get larger and are readable. Perhaps a sliding scale to let us choose the text size, or a choice of three text sizes for us to choose, S M L.   Second, allow us to have a finger touch offset to where the actual screen information will be shown. As I slide finger on earthquakes, especially clusters, I don’t know which location is being read with its pop-up screen. Perhaps an option of a slider that moves the effective touch area upwards from the physical touched area with a small bubble to show the area being selected. It will remove frustration.   Great job to all your team.  Torrance Californua USA 1/24/2022","5"
"951","Earthquake","Trustworthy app.","5"
"952","Earthquake","I just purchased this app one day ago on 2-13-21 and I got the pro version and I’m totally happy with it. I can’t believe what’s going on with planet earth. I live in the Pacific Northwest and I’m surrounded by volcanoes and it’s important to know in real time what’s going on. I’ve got my app setup to alert me right away if a quake happens and you can adjust the magnitude to suit your needs. I recommend this app highly and I’m a picky person. Get the pro version it’s worth the 3.99 and that’s not even one cup of coffee at your local coffee place if you know what I mean👍👍👍👍👍💯💯💯👍👍👍👍👍😁😁😁","5"

"958","Earthquake","You know (hope) an app like this will provide all the basic info and details about our shaky earth. This one does and a lot more than I expected. They didn't stop at the science -- they understand how vital it is to tie so much rolling data together visually. THIS is why the app stands far ahead of the others.  After looking at so many earthquake apps I settled on this one because of its interface and visual design e.g. solid red page tops, nice looking maps, event icons, easy to read scrolling info, intuitive setup settings, and smooth movement when thumbing around the world.  This app is high end but not arrogant in its sophisticated dynamic. You kinda want to spend more time with it.  I URGE the developers of this app to add one vital data point to the notifications/scrolling data list -- the duration of the event. This info dynamic could be part of the setup choices, too.  I was in the brunt of the 2011 Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C. earthquake that lasted 43 seconds 5.9M at that. On 11 March 2011 the great Northeast Japan earthquake aka Great Sendai Earthquake and Tsunami lasted for more than 6.2 minutes at 9.0 -- and when you watch the YouTube videos of the quake you just shake your head.  So as important as the magnitude, location, time etc. I always want to know how long the event lasted.  I've not found it yet but is there a way to organize events by location/region (or nation) with a map dotted with the appropriate quake icons.  ***** This is the very first iPhone 6 Plus app I've ever felt compelled to rate; a good five stars.","5"
"959","Earthquake","Every time I check I have to re-enter the search area. Weather.com will remember my location, but this app doesn’t. Frustrating! I’m in California, USA. I don’t want notifications for Indonesia.  And yes, I am connected to WiFi.","1"

"963","Earthquake","I downloaded it after the earthquake in Mexico city on 09/19/2017. I thought the app would have more options to set up an alert and that it would provide the alarm to evacuate.

"1","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I live in Northern California, US, and have been looking for an app that shows quake activity in the area. I tried a few different ones first but they were either too global or didn’t include any below 2.0. This app allows me to set my specific location area, and shows all seismic activity (even below 1.0), where/when it occurred, and how far away from my location. Was easy to set up my preferences, and was exactly what I needed. Will definitely recommend to others. Thank you!!","5"
"2","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I really like this app and by changing the numbers to only 3.0 or over makes less to sort through.  Even though the reads are not always accurate I can double check on a more scientific site and get the correct read.  Also some numbers change after getting all the facts.  It takes a few minutes after a quake hits for an alert, but better than going to a computer and typing into a site, as they are normally deluged by too many nervous people.  I would recommend this app.","5"
"3","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The app is good. It is simple and easy to use. However I had noticed in the months after downloading the app that my phone’s battery didn’t last as long as it used to. Looking at the battery section in settings, it showed that the earthquake app was responsible for 22% of my battery usage with it open for 99 hours in the background during a single week. I use my phone A LOT so the app having 22% of my battery usage in the past week is no easy feat. I don’t know what it could be doing in the background to be using all that battery but it doesn’t really matter to me as I am deleting the app.","3"
"4","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I downloaded this because my dad lives in the Bay Area and is hesitant to try one of these app himself, so far of the 3 apps I’ve tried, this is the most customizable in terms of location and magnitude customization BUT I really wish I could add multiple locations and have alerts for my area in the NW as well as Bay Area and maybe even one for other family members in SoCal too. Why not let people monitor multiple locations. It’s very common to have loved ones in other states we may want to be aware of eq activity nearby them to check in with them.","4"
"5","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I really like to keep myself informed of what’s going on around the world, this app really helps me to really do that effectively. I on the spot minute by minute hour by hour record of the earthquakes that are happening Surat the world I find really informative and very helpful in keeping abreast of what’s going on on this planet while it’s happening! I really can’t recommend this app any higher than a five star review if I could I most certainly would I’d love it!","5"
"6","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app makes it so easy to monitor quakes and their details - stuff you need to know NOW. It’s the best quake app I’ve used to date and I’ve tried a few. I live on the North Coast of California and we just had a 6.4 quake last night and sooo many aftershocks, all day today. I do wish it had tsunami warning info readily available as I live in a tsunami zone. Otherwise, I’m so thankful for this app! Especially last night and today!","5"
"7","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","There was an excellent app called QuakeSpotter, which is no longer in the App Store, but still works. Unfortunately it recently stopped pulling data from everywhere except the Mediterranean and Middle East regions, so I thought I would try My Earthquake Alerts. Unfortunately the layout isn’t as good as QuakeSpotter. It’s especially annoying that the map is only shown on less than half of the screen and the rest of the screen shows recent earthquakes. On QuakeSpotter these were on separate screens accessible via the menu.","3"
"8","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I like this application very much and sends messages very quickly following happening in California. (The other day it sent a text within a minute of feeling a 5 magnitude). I wish that you could choose to select more than one state to monitor instead of having to choose between all states or just one.... I live in So Cal and my parents live right off the Juan De Fuca plate In Oregon (tsunami flood area). Setting alarms for both states would allow me to monitor what’s happening where I live and where loved ones live concurrently.","4"
"9","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app sounded my preset alarm for a earthquake near my location and within seconds the building was shaking, items falling off shelves and the walls but I was able to get me and my family to a safe place until the shaking stopped and then we went outside just in case the 7 aftershocks we withstood afterwards didn’t cause our home to collapse. This app also gave me information about every aftershock also","5"
"10","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I have been notified earthquake events as they happen.  I live in AK, a place with moderate activity, so it is  nice to have this running in the background.  I keep mental tracking of where the activity is and then when we have s shaker here I will actively review the past 24-48 hours and to see if there is a potential threat to my community that I need to pay attention to.  I like this app and will continue to use it.  It is easy to use, gives essential info sans fluff","5"
"11","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I love this app! We know what we’re feeling but this confirms it. It’s very detailed on where the quakes and aftershocks are, it’s amazing we have this technology! I have and will continue to recommend this app to all my California family and friends. It assists us in our game of how big was it and where was it!!!!! Thank you for all the fun and information!!!! Not that earthquakes are fun but you have to do something to shake off your nerves!!!!!!","5"
"12","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The app says it’s designed to give warnings in advance of an earthquake. So far I’ve gotten all kinds of warnings, none of which were near my state. I live in northern Washington. I’m getting warnings when using the “nearby” feature from Southern California. I’m pretty sure in no way is that “nearby.” The FAQ says the app will increase the distance based on magnitude. The app just told me there was a 3.2 earthquake in Southern California. Yeah, that’s not going to impact me. If they can iron out this issue the app will be useful but so far all it does is give pointless jump scares.","2"
"13","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I really appreciate how this app works to inform the user is the seismic activity going on around the world. One way it could be better if/when appropriate would be to add more detail about the activity (such as “feels/felt like” or any damage or casualties that happened as a result if applicable). Another detail, as much as science makes it possible, would be to have predictors of future seismic activity and potential severity.","5"
"14","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I like this earthquake notification app and it’s flexibility. I can set whatever part of the world or country I want to be notified of. I can also set what severity I want to be notified of. The reason that I docked it one star is the delay. The last alert came 3 hours after the earthquake hit. While this is interesting to know about it doesn’t provide any safety aspect unless you use it to anticipate aftershocks. Perhaps the delay is the fault of the reporting agency and not the app.","4"
"15","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Enjoyable Feed, but seems to have missed one, and missed two entry blanks?   The Contact Support choices Question and Problem seem to have no place to type anything in?    And, today Tuesday 25 Oct 2022, CNN tweeted a R5 quake near San Jose CA, and there is a lot of chatter about it, but your Earthquake app is silent about it while still posting other quakes?","5"
"16","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Been using for around two years, very happy with interface, definitely set it to only alert if mag 3+, especially if you also live in an earthquake prone location. Alerts me within a reasonable time after the events, updates itself often to correct most incorrectly posted data, and, as always, it’s super free!! Must have, anywhere near fault lines!","5"
"17","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Three things would make this a better app. First, make it possible to remove the information box that pops up in the middle of the screen preventing being able to see the area of the quake. Second, include markers for all the quake activity in that area. It’s nice to be able to see how many earthquakes have taken place in an area. Third, have the ability to keep the quake information for more than just a day.","3"
"18","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It shows or tells me most ofthe things I want to know, but could us a few teeaks.  Top of my list right now: 1) my country is large so I have it set to show “nearby” events but I can’t see let alone change the definition of “near” that it uses, and 2) it says a quake epicenter is a certain distance and direction from some thing that doesn’t appear on the map","5"
"19","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Do you ever actually look at how your viewers set their app. I set it for United States only and I get world wide. That is more than I care to look through the whole world I’m done if you can’t fix this within the next few days. Very disappointed in this  app. If it can’t be set for the United States of America. I will delete","5"
"20","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app is really great 👍 it definitely notifies me when and/or just before one hits in my area. The alarm 🚨 is loud even when I forget to turn my phone alarm up.  The first time or two I wasn’t quite sure what the alarm 🚨 sounded like BUT now I do and have a safe place set up inside with blankets just in case.","5"
"21","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I got this app about 9 months ago, and I didn’t think much of it, because my area is seismically quiet.  But the alarm went off for the 6.9 in Hawaii while I was at work, and it took more than 10 minutes for the internet news to catch up.  Very accurate, very quick alert time, easy to use filters.  Thank you for making this.","5"
"22","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I love that I set it for my region and it alerts me immediately of any earthquakes within my region/area. It is a wide area that it covers. Does not mean I feel them. However, being and staying alerted of what’s going on around us is an amazing thing. Getting coverage of my Southern California, Northern, Central, etc. LOVE IT! I set it for earthquakes above 3.0.","5"
"23","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","That’s literally it, you cannot set a range, ‘nearby’ is the closest you can get to your location and ‘nearby’ is about a 200 miles radius....I have mine set to alert me if there is an earthquake above a 4...but I don’t care if it’s happening 200 miles away...I wish you could make that radius a LOT smaller like 25 miles or 10 mile radius. If that changed the app would be great","4"
"24","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I payed for the pro version about a year or so ago. The app works great however I don’t think its fair having to pay for it again for having a new phone. I’ll pay the 2.99 again because my parents are in PR and I like monitoring the quakes plus the app is worth it. I give 5 stars to the Pro version because I can set the quake alerts based on my specifications and are super effective and timely.","3"
"25","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","sent Immediately after all earthquakes worldwide!  The app goes beyond its call of duty of “real time” notifications, by sending a detailed summary notifications about previous earthquakes. The ended to my search for an earthquake app started when I found this one, it’s well worth downloading ✌🏼","5"
"26","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","We had a minor event and I wanted a quick place to find info. Did a quick search and tried this app. They had the information available within the 5 minutes it took me to find and get the app. Same as USGS and a nice display.","5"
"27","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Better to know about them and act accordingly. I was raised mostly in the Far East, lotsa shaking going on there.  When Dad retired to SF area, it didn’t change.  Now, 5 decades later, I still find we’re never that far from some movement, so have a plan.  I start with a doorway and go from there, always looking for any kids nearby.","5"
"28","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Can’t seem to get local earthquakes on screen any longer. I was getting the local quakes here in calif mostly. That’s okay. But I know their has to be more quakes on California than other parts of the us. And the quakes are mostly outside of the U.S.  why should I buy the pro edition if the free one changes itself without me making changes.","5"
"29","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I looked at several earthquake reporting apps.  For readability, timeliness, settings, accuracy, user interface and more, I believe that this is the best one.  If you live in an earthquake-prone area, or know people who do, or are just interested in earthquakes, get this one.  Try it out with ads, or go “pro”.  5-Stars.","5"
"30","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The app looks and feels great, but for some odd reason, it is only in Spanish and doesn’t seem to have an option in settings to manually change it to English. My phone is in Swedish, so my system language isn’t the problem, but I am located in Chile right now so I assume that it automatically changes to the language of your location? I don’t know, but regardless, I can’t understand it, so I’ll have to delete it.","3"
"31","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I feel the lightest of earthquakes and live in Southern California. Earthquakes are prone to happen here and sometimes I freak out because I feel my bed lightly shaking and other don’t feel it and literally, moments later, the app goes off alerting me of a nearby earthquake. Usually they’ve been miles away and felt lightly to a jolt but the Earthquake App is on it!","5"
"32","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Gives excellent info on local activity, with good settings to manage the notifications by region and intensity.  Data feed is really good & fast with notifications arriving within one or two minutes (if not faster) of feeling a small earthquake.","5"
"33","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","My only complaint is that I can’t filter the alerts by proximity. I’m in LA so I keep getting notifications of 3M+ earthquakes around the Ridgecrest area. I want to get alerts for 3M+ within 20 miles of my location, and 5M+ within 200mi radius. That would be much more relevant for me, if we could define “nearby” so I could actually understand which earthquakes may actually impact us.  Otherwise it’s much more useful and informative than ShakeAlert.","3"
"34","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app works all the time , it updates for earthquakes in minutes , it actually let me know about the shaking several seconds before my relatives in Mexico felt it!! They were able to get out of the house before the earthquake!! Amazing app!","5"
"35","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I really like this app.  It’s simple and easy to use and gives extra information with just a tap of my finger.  I purchased the yearly ad free option for very little money which makes even better.","5"
"36","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Used to be a very good app when it first came on the store, now even though I have the notifications on and I set it up for certain quakes, it gives me notifications once in a blue moon, like today’s 7.3 Japan earthquake, it didn’t notified me, only the 5.5 one; what’s up with that??? With every update it’s worse and worse. I’ll give it couple more weeks and then I’ll delete it, it’s very poor lately.","2"
"37","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Is to let the user be able to set a “miles from my location” number so that I would get alerts about events that actually may affect me. So far, the alerts have been from far away events, irrelevant to my safety, and stressful for no good reason. I would like this app to be more of a tool and less of a novelty. Thanks!","3"
"38","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Every quake that has happened near me has the magnitude listed with in seconds. This app lays the earthquake on a map that is simple and has only the info you need. Along with this you are able to customize what is shown on the app and when it alerts you.","5"
"39","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I have several quake Apps and  this App. Seems to get the ones greater than 3 much faster than the other two I do wish that when you look geographically where the quake is it would show other recent ones in same area. This is my go-to","5"
"40","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Works well and gives enough information to be helpful.  Easy to set parameters, only see what is important to you.  Quickly see where the quake happened in relation to you.  I’d recommend the app.","5"
"41","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I live a bicoastal life and to be able to be alerted if an earthquake has occurred when I am on the opposite coast is wonderful. Customer service is amazing also. I sent email asking about being able to localize the alerts even more and I received an answer I. Less than 24 hrs.","5"
"42","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I like that the earthquake list seems to be very up-to-date. However, twice the Alert notification went off in the middle of the night for quakes in Ridgeland,Ca (where there was already hundreds of tremors the last couple of days). I live 125 miles away. So the notifications needs work. I had to turn all notifications off for now.","3"
"43","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Allows you to see most recent quake activity, and choose which quakes you want to review by clicking on the push-pins on the map. Fairly easy to understand. Zoom in or out on the map to see other recent activity.","5"
"44","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I personally praised you in email because your app had no adverts but I’m fairly certain you snuck one in recently, probably with your recent update-  to buy some other app.    For an app with supposedly somewhat of a “higher” purpose - advertisements clutter, distract; and just tarnishes your app’s credibility.  I’d just rather pay you a nominal app fee (99¢) and be done with any ads.   I don’t want the other app either.","2"
"45","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app is so convenient. It doesn’t go off too much and I really like knowing where there is an earthquake in my state. I like being able to control which ones (strength)are going to alert me.","5"
"46","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I live in San Francisco and we have been experiencing continuous earthquakes for the past two weeks.  I have shared this app with friends and neighbors and they tell me that they feel a little better prepared  to go into survival mode.","5"
"47","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Love this app. Zooms in on visual for last earthquake. Adjust the magnitude from  broad scale. I have heard about explosions going on underground in the cities. So I am narrowing my scope to my state and dropped it to 1.0 to see if you guys can pick up on some of this DeepUMB activity","5"
"48","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This is the best Earthquake app available. It is fast, showing you the quake data almost immediately or just in a few minutes. Easy interface to set the preferences. I have tried many apps but this one is the best!👍👍👍","5"
"49","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I love this app, it's exactly what I needed. I live in the New Madrid seismic zone so it's nice to know when the New Madrid fault is acting up. Besides that I'm very interested in all things connected with geology and this planet that we live on so this app is much appreciated. Its easy to use and designed to be enjoyed and informed.","5"
"50","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Simple, easy for anyone- makes sense. It can smoothly do some important options, available. Well worth paying a little extra for the ‘no ads’ version. I live in west CA where a quick check is doable.  Dustin Hellstern, 38","5"
"51","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I really like how this is set up. However, I wish the pins that show the location of the quake, would be proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake. So the bigger the quake the bigger the pin location. But so far, that is all u don’t “like” about it. I do like u can have two different settings for notifications and size shown on the map.","3"
"52","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This earthquake app is so very accurate and when I’ve had any issue with it there was someone to talk to. One can zoom in on these quakes and tell when people are gonna be affected by the structures, traffic and general area that a quake has occurred. I use this app all the time!! Love it!!","5"
"53","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I had another earthquake app, but it never seemed to let me know about the quakes. This one does it’s fascinating to see how often the earth moves in California. I have it set to show any quakes above 3.0.  Our Faults have been active lately.","5"
"54","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I end up browsing this app every time I see it in my list, how amazing is it, the things going on around us that we don't focus on until we are given a tool that does such a elegant display of the world around us, and under us! Wow","5"
"55","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","We’ve heard that there’s about 2,000 low impact earthquake tremors in Alaska every year so now we are more precisely aware of where they all are.   Also, we are aware that Planet Earth is alive & growing with each of these movements, thanks to an old video diagram by Neil Adams.","5"
"56","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I have had other quake apps on my phone before,but THIS app is by far the BEST. You can set the magnitude and locations in the “settings” and see where and what size; have recommended to family and friends..I’d give it 10 stars if I could !! THANK YOU,for a great app 👍","5"
"57","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Juste a suggestion. I need to be able select and copy text from the app, as location info for example. Right now it’s impossible. Or another way to show le location on google maps. Many thanks.","4"
"58","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","My husband works in the pahala area. Which is the area of Hawaii island that currently has a up tick of volcanic earthquakes. Due to the unrest of our active volcano Mauna Loa. So this app gives me peace of mind and or anxiety. Lol. It allows us to know his evacuation route if a eruption was imminent. Great app. Must download.","5"
"59","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The site has become way too cluttered with days of activity. It was much more clear when it contained only 24 hours of activity. Now it just bogs you down.","5"
"60","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Earthquake reports in real time. It’s fast and seems to be accurate. Handy information to have at your fingertips, especially when you or loved ones live in an earthquake zone.","5"
"61","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I live in Iran where government lies about everything even the magnitude of quakes! So I took advantage of installing this app and get a hold on useful information about recent earthquakes in my country. Very well done guys.","5"
"62","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I do not like that an invitation tostar, then write a review did not have an x to opt out. I could not read the list of earthquakes because the pop up box could not be removed without writing something. Annoying.","4"
"63","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It works otherwise well but notifications come way too late. We just had an earthquake and notification came 3 minutes after the shaking finished.","4"
"64","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The notifications are helpful and like being able to see where the quake originated and how far away it is from my location.","5"
"65","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Been using this app for years and it never fails. Keeping it on my phone until there’s a better warning system in place to save us from earthquakes in the future.","5"
"66","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Good information. However, it would be nice if we could choose more specific areas for notifications. Too broad. I really don’t care much about ‘off the coast of Alaska’ etc. I do want to know about states I have family in. But you cave that specific, it’s kind of all or nothing.","3"
"67","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I don’t really have an actual purpose for using this app other than just to entertain my curiosity and interest in earthquakes as I live by the Great Lakes so earthquakes aren’t exactly common and are weak. That being said the app is nicely designed and is stable.","5"
"68","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I can’t send the email that I’m trying to send you with the info about my problem and the app doesn’t work… Nothing works! Why does nothing send??!","5"
"69","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Earthquake alerts me way before any of the other apps. It’s important to know what is happening nearby - I might not feel it- but at least I’m aware and can be ready to act if necessary.","5"
"70","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Thank you for this app. Sometimes it’s hard to know if Van Nys is shooting something or an earthquake. With this app we can open our phones and we are told if it’s an earthquake.","5"
"71","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It’s a powerful reminder how our Earth is a dynamic place where it’s life is viewed as its movements to remind us that we are just visitors living our short lives on a beautiful and powerful place.","5"
"72","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The alerts go off accurately, most other 3D earthquake alerts do so sporadically. This one does well, although they all applications neglect Washington, I am unable to ‘zoom’ in on the state and do not get alerts from there either.  USGS what’s up?","5"
"73","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Any time I feel the earth move or hear of an earthquake on the news, I jump onto this app. It is always right on within minutes","5"
"74","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I’ve been using a different app. Then found that it was not giving me reports that I get from here. Very happy with the service   It’s free and entirely up to an individual to help them out. Love that. Thanks","5"
"75","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","No one can never predict what’s going to happen, but if you know where in win and how much it was on the Richter scale, then that’s not a bad thing to have immediately and it works well too!","5"
"76","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Thank you so much for all the current notifications I like finding out ahead not having to wait to hear on the news you even notify before Facebook","5"
"77","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This is a grade app, except for the fact that I have it set for near me, which is supposed to be my state,, and the region is set for my state, and I’m getting notifications for everywhere. This means, very frequent notifications. I only want notifications for near me, not notifications in California, Mexico, and other places that are not my state.","2"
"78","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Sitting on an island it’s good to know where is the earthquake coming from that may generate a tidelwave. It gives you plenty of time to run to the middle of the island....","5"
"79","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I live in Washington State and an earthquake happened in Oregon and my alarm went off. I love this app. Scared me at first but now I know what to expect when one happens in Washington when they get this installed.","5"
"80","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It shows quakes I am interested in however, on more than one occasion it has not reported earthquakes I have felt.  I live in an area where frequently we have quakes.  This past week we have had many quakes. Daily I have experienced earthquakes and several had not shown up in your app.","3"

"85","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Just had those scary Ridgecrest earthquakes and this came up with the data before the news did. I’m in SoCal and an earthquake veteran, and being able to pull up info within seconds is really nice.","5"
"86","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The concept behind this app, is profoundly pertinent to societies welfare, and well being!

"87","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I no longer enjoy using this app. So much advertising and the layout no matter how much I make setting adjustments is not to my liking. Nor are the quakes updated as should be","5"
"88","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The Richter Scale for measuring earthquakes hasn’t been used for 30+ years, and not mentioned in any media for more than two decades. Need to use Moment Magnitude Scale. For writing purposes, a 3.7 earthquake would be said to be a “Magnitude 3.7 earthquake” or written “M 3.7”.  Richter was a bad, and now obsolete, scale. Thank you.","4"
"89","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Only thing I wish was available was the ability to set multiple notifications.  For example, all nearby quakes over 3.0 AND all worldwide quakes over 7.0.","5"
"90","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I am learning where earthquakes are very common. I expected to see more earthquakes in California at a 4 level and was surprised that they are not as common as I thought.","5"
"91","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Free version is too simplistic. “Show fault lines” in CA shows only the SA fault, when there are hundreds of faults CA. Couldn’t find a “recent quakes” parameter, it just shows the single quake. So I only find it helpful for the notifications - after which I go to the USGS site.","4"
"92","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Downloaded the app right after an earthquake. Learned how to use it in 2 minutes","5"
"93","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Always there for you when you need it and help you with your knowledge","5"
"94","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I only wanted to know the earthquakes in my state and in my area. I get more alerts about Mexico than I do in my own state that I live in or around my immediate area which is full of faultlines. I have done everything possible to get this app to stop showing me everything around the world it will not stay or has ever worked.","1"
"95","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Needs an on/off option outside the app and maybe a few niceties but overall impressed.","5"
"96","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I enjoy this app very much. It has been my go to app when I have a concern or I may want to find out the latest earthquakes. Thank you","5"
"97","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I'm map view when presenting summary data for each Pin it makes more sense to show the magnitude and time rather than location as the location is already known because it's being presented on a map.","3"
"98","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","We live in California. This app tells us whether we are experiencing an earthquake or a big truck rumbling down the road. Very helpful!","5"
"99","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I live on the Big Island of Hawaii where we have earthquakes daily. Most are so small you can’t feel them but this app shows me every earthquake, their magnitude and location.  This app is fantastic! I love it!❤️","5"
"100","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I live this app. My husband heard the alert for the first time yesterday and he wasn't sure what it was I told him and now he has the app in his phone. Like love love this app.","5"
"101","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Good to know where things are happening. Amazed how many earthquakes that happen around you that you can’t feel.?","5"
"102","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I live close to an active fault line in Texas and keep feeling earthquakes and at first was like, was that an earthquake or did an accident just happen?  Now I know it was an earthquake that just shook the walls!!!  Thanks!","5"
"103","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I love this app – we were in our in Mexico in the state of Chiapas and experienced an 8.1 earthquake – it's giving us amazing information also about the after-shocks – it's essential out for us!!!!!","5"
"104","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","So usually their is not many earthquakes in our area. But this app tells me when an earthquake is nearby so I been using this app since!","5"
"105","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I consider this app a great one cause it let you know right away when a earthquake hit the area... the best thing for me is that I set it to let me know when there’s quake if 5.0 or more.","5"
"106","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Nice layout n options n the App is pretty good w its alerts. That said a few much choices as to what alert tones we have to choose from would be a good thing","5"
"107","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I have been using to keep informed of earthquakes occurring in Puerto Rico for the past week and it has helped maintain us informed. At the begin the posting where almost simultaneous with earthquakes but I am noticing it is taking more time to record.","4"

"119","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This App has been very informative since we had the big one on November 30. Nice to know about the after shocks were and how strong. Thank you.","5"
"120","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app is really awkward and not that helpful. Living in California I just want to see earthquakes near me and I cannot get it to only show those around me I have to see them all around the world.  That should be much easier in settings to do than it is.","2"
"121","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Prompt, accurate tracking of earthquakes worldwide. Easy to use. Settings are fun to explore. Recommend this app to all with an interest in earthquakes. Mimi Begun","5"
"122","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I have been an earthquake watcher for several years. Learn about geography an how the earths movement affects us.","5"
"123","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","When I try to search for specific magnitudes, it comes up blank screen. Several attempts made. Same results. Fix please. Thx! Overall, I like this app. Very handy.","3"
"124","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This site gives you your info very fast and keeps you up to date on the earthquakes in your area.  I love this site!❤️","5"
"125","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This program requires special attention to programming details just to get the program running.    As of now the program does not provide the basic features it proclaims.  No sound,no notification of a earthquake that is occurring, or that has occurred. We were hoping that the basic features would work.... hopefully....!","1"
"126","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Living in Earthquake country I appreciate the ability to check activity in my immediate area. I have experienced several earthquakes in my living area in my 78 years.","5"
"127","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It would be better if it would have the ability to show population. All in all a very informative APP.","5"
"128","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I have always been interested in earthquakes and where they happen. This app is super cool!!","5"
"129","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I love the app one suggestion is that it shows a ring around the earthquakes as to how far away it can be felt","5"
"130","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Living on the San Andreas keeps earthquakes near and dear to one’s heart (and all other body parts). This app is the best I’ve used for simplicity to receive vital information.","5"
"131","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Excellent app and very accurate but the notifications are coming to me 4 hours ahead. How or where I can change or adjust the time in the app. I'm in the Caribbean zone.","4"
"132","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The application although has a good intention it has a delay as we live in the center mountain top side of the island and we felt the earthquake, but it wasn’t until around 5 minutes later that the app alert sounded and advised about the 5.1 epicenter in the south side shake.","3"
"133","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It is reassuring to know when we are having an earthquake and when it is something else - like. Heavy footed person walking in the hall or the wind blowing gusts at the side of the house. It’s a good tool.","5"
"134","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Always notifies me before I hear it from anywhere else!","5"
"135","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Simple, easy to use, and quick! This has the fastest reporting out of four apps that I have tried.","5"

"138","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Thank to this app I can monitor the earthquakes back home in Puerto Rico  And being able to communicate with my family when anything above 3.5 aftershocks","5"
"139","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I find this app to be one of the few that reflect a contribution, when comparing how many exist and how many function well.","5"
"140","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app is helpful when it comes to verifying a Earthquake, however it doesn’t let you know immediately when an Earthquake is happening at the exact moment.","4"
"141","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Purchased the no-ad option.  Data is easy to read and intelligently laid out.  Thank you!","5"
"142","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app is really great.  It alerts me anytime a quake happens within a certain distance of me even if I’m offline.  Very handy to have!","5"
"143","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I like getting the notices. Yet when I get one and click on it, it takes me to the app but not the earthquake I clicked on. And then I can't even find the one that brought me there. It's a bit frustrating.","3"
"144","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Gives complete picture and reports all earthquakes around the globe.","5"
"145","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I paid for no advertising and since there saying my location is Glendale that is not my location it’s San Fernando. Plus it hasn’t gone off once and there is activity. Please fix this since I paid for it. Thanks.","3"
"146","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I paid for the paid version and then took it off my phone months later but when I tried to download it again, it's asking me to pay again. Why? I shouldn't have to pay for it each time I download it..it should be an option to restore purchases.","1"
"147","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I will like notifications closest to when earthquakes happen in my area","5"
"148","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It is my peace of mind and the way That I’m in touch with life scenarios, where it may affect my family to survive 🧐.","5"
"149","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Always current!!","5"
"150","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","If you want to keep tabs on earthquakes around the world, this app is for you.  I really like the ability to filter by earthquake magnitude.    Overall, very nice app.","5"
"151","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It’s great! But, response time is slow. Don’t know if it’s because there are so many happening at once.... Very interesting app:)","5"
"152","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Downloaded recently while vacationing in LA. Was very helpful and received many notifications for earthquakes. Kept us informed and aware at all times.","5"
"153","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","But I noticed recently there are long red lines all over the maps. What do these lines mean?","5"
"154","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Constantly have to reset settings !! Why does the app not state where the location is . It just says It is near itself . We want to know what area is next to it . I just want to know about calif but I get all regions constantly . Please reset your app Rita R Ruiz","2"
"155","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Like this app keeps me informed on are earthquakes! It’s quite interesting on just how many quakes we have!😎","5"
"156","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Since the big quake on January 7, 2020 hit Puerto Rico, I downloaded the App and it has been extremely helpful in notifying the earthquakes in this region.","5"
"157","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","My go-to source for timely earthquake information","5"
"158","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","New to this app because of being on the east coast of Florida .  Amazing all the activities Mother Earth has going on .  Thanks","5"
"159","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This is very accurate. An essential tool during these difficult days","5"
"160","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I am too new on this ap yet to give a 5 score. But I will try and view the ap daily to really give a more honest opinion. Thank you for inviting me to grade you.  Claire","4"
"161","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It’s a great app but I wish it had the faults names on them just for more knowledge  Thank you D.Do","5"
"162","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The syrens sounds minutes after the shakes, this is too much time to save your life during the emergency.  If you want an app that to be informed after, this is the one, but if you want one that alert you during the event is happening this one isn’t the one that you need.","1"
"163","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I like how I get the alarm notifications for a quake but it is delayed and so defeats the purpose of having an alarm. If I heard there was a local quake, I don’t see it on notifications.","4"
"164","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Use it every day to keep track of events. Very easy to use but very comprehensive.","5"
"165","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I get earthquake reports faster from my local news than this app. Really disappointed- thought it would be more real time data. It’s 9:32am and a 5.0 earthquake happened one hour ago In Humbolt county where my daughter lives - this app still hasn’t posted it. Worthless- going to delete it.","1"
"166","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Can’t figure out how to set it to look for earthquakes just in my area.  Have not been able to figure out how in a week of using it.","3"
"167","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I’d like to have the option of removing all the worldwide quakes so I can zoom in and read my area! Hawai’i","4"
"168","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Would like just my area","5"
"169","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","To the developers of this app, I would recommend color coding the pins by the magnitude of the earthquake. Currently you can’t easily find higher magnitude earthquakes","3"
"170","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Thanks.  Love to check EXACTLY WHERE, & HOW BIG THEY REALLY ARE.  Also to make sure they’re far enough away so I don’t have to be concerned.  See which way they’re going.","5"
"171","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Very good on notifications, setting earthquake level above 5.0.  It keeps you in touch with mother earth.","5"
"172","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This is the best earthquake tracker I’ve seen so far. I would however like to see the ability to better select the area to watch... something like “contiguous states”.","4"
"173","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Nice app but wished it would do what I want it to not what it wants to.  Crazy loco technology we can’t live without, so ready for those transformer bugs.","4"
"174","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I like the app. I just don’t want the Bottom half of my screen to have six other countries information that I can’t remove.","3"
"175","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Central Coast California. This application is very cool, when I feel a earthquake I immediately look on the app to see the size and location. Great entertainment app.","5"
"176","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Right now we should all have free Premium. Don’t you think since we are in the Central and Southern California regions and going through the quakes","4"
"177","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app should be upgraded -tells me the state when a quake is delayed.  i.e. 2.00 Salt Lake City 2 hours ago doesn’t tell me what state the quake occurred in. Should say 2.00 Salt Lake City, Utah 2 hours ago. -customize locations for alerts by state section, by county","3"
"178","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It’s not bad but hate the advert. Doesn’t need to be there under any circumstances. This is supposed to be for emergency not for adverts. It could be a little clearer and give cities compared to such a wide area","4"
"179","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I have gone to settings and entered the info I want to follow and it will not correctly post it. Example post 3.5 for California only. It posted everything from everywhere  Update  I’m still seeing other states  I ONLY WANT CALIFORNIA!","2"
"180","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Although an owner of this app for 2 years, I find it most helpful at this moment due to Two major Earthquakes and over 5,000 aftershocks.  I monitor distance and aftershocks in order for state of preparation!  I advertised this App. On my Facebook where many were unaware of its presents.  They are now and bought your Version.","5"
"181","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Love this app! The only thing that I don’t like is the notifications show km instead of miles. And I have miles selected.","5"
"182","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This provides relatively accurate coverage, the lag between real-time and when EQ’s occur is way behind some of the other apps out there. Aside from the lag I like this app.","3"
"183","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Let's you keep up to date around the world. Easy to use and adjust the settings on the strength of the quakes displayed.","5"
"184","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Been very helpful for me, I don’t get overly anxious everytime I feel something weird","5"
"185","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Really enjoying this app…. Nice work developers!","5"
"186","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The app should be a little faster when notifying the scale and magnitude, sometimes it takes more than 20 minutes after the shock..","3"
"187","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I really like your app. Only problem is the box with info stays in the middle of the map.","5"
"188","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Better than the last App I had. It’s just what I needed. I live in Puerto Rico. It would be even better if the time of occurrence was correct.","5"
"189","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Instead of “8 hours ago” could say the 10:00 pm.  The exact time.","5"
"190","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I check this app almost daily to see the activity. Pretty easy operation. Good information on the quakes. I think it’s great!","5"
"191","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I recently got this App, and was so very surprised to see how many earthquakes are occurring so frequently through out the world.  Great App will certainly recommend.","4"
"192","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I love this app. I just wish I had more space for the map. But I just love it. Thanks","5"
"193","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I only want to see the quakes in the USA and Canada. I dont see a thing about the small quake that occurred by me a few days ago.

"210","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This is not an app to count on for accurate information for earthquakes. Finally deleted it and choosing another app that actually delivers. No improvement since my last review last year. Pathetic.","1"

"219","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","In my country, Puerto Rico at this moments we have a lot of Earth this app provide one method for alert and protect live of all us","5"
"220","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The app it has a lot of advertisements and appears in the bottom of the screen close to the option bar. It’s annoyingly special when they offered women faces to encourage you to get an app where you can call them. Very disgusting","1"

"258","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Needs to have an option to set a permanent set point so it doesn’t have to keep tracking where I am at.

"268","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Keep up the good work informing us.","5"
"269","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It would be nice if it didn’t have misleading ads along the bottom of the screen.   Instead of getting “Breaking News”, you get tagged by google ads and doubleclick.  I found the “Pro” version in the app store by mistake, you should be able to click on an “upgrade” button within the app.  Don’t bother with this one, get the pro version. It costs next to nothing and is money well spent to not deal with ads you can’t tell are ads.","1"
"270","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I don't think I received one notification from the app it wasn't at least 12 hours late.","2"

"611","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Awesome","5"
"612","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Does everything I want it to do and does it well, without clutter! Simple and straightforward app, but in all the best ways. Living in the Bay Area it's nice to be able to check was that a small earthquake or just my neighbors doing something crazy again? (Usually it's just the neighbors) The push notifications are unobtrusive and can be set to your specific needs very easily. My only request would be to have a hyper-local notification setting. While I don't want to know about every 2.5 in my part of the country via push notification, it would be awesome to be notified of that within the Bay Area specifically. (Maybe that is available in the premium version? Not sure, guess I'll have to try it out at some point!) At any rate, this app is great and I highly recommend it. :)","5"
"613","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I love the stream of information, and I love the way it is presented.  I just wish there was an In-App Purchase to remove the ads, because those do detract from the experience of using it.  This app would totally be worth paying for.  I have continued to use it after the initial novelty -- I did not know the Earth was continuously ringing like a bell. Update: D'oh!!  How did I not see there was a Pro version when I looked at the App Store search results and downloaded this version?!  For only two bones, the Pro version is a no-brainer.  I upgraded.","5"
"614","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Just had a quake. First I downloaded a higher rated app based on number of ratings, QuakeFeed, and then this one. Far superior! Easy to use, had current data, great visuals.   Wish someday an update would include early alert alarm function based on initial primary waves that arrive slightly before damaging secondary shock waves.   Moral of this story: Give this app 5 stars to bump it up on App Store ratings so others will also download and benefit! (I am not associated in any way with app makers, lol!)","5"
"615","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I have nothing to criticize in this application and can say that it is just what I would want it to be (ads too) since it is free. Some complain that it takes 30 minutes to post an earthquake that just happened under their feet. Well, pony up for e pensive earthquake warnings, then! I live in an area (Maine USA) where a 2.0 quake within 200 miles is big news. I like to check this app once in a while, look at all the frequent shakes in places like New Zealand and the Aleutians, and smugly rest easy that I need worry only about forest fires. That's what I use it for: to remind me about forest fires.","4"
"616","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Does what it says.  Accurate & reliable.  I would love only make one change: please can you lose the exclamation point for anything less than a 4.5-5...Its embarrassing 😊 Settings allow notification parameters to be predetermined, so, I set mine at 3, even though I can barely begin to notice at 3.  Parameter choices include  nearby, State, Region, Continent, and magnitude settings,  very trustworthy data.","5"
"617","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Apps for the weather have earned a place on our devices. They come in handy, day-to-day, and earn their spurs for severe threats. Earthquakes can be much worse than weather events. They strike almost anywhere and affect family members and friends without warning. It just makes sense to have a reliable alert available around the clock.","5"
"618","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","We are always a shaking so this is perfect to have to see/know when we have good size ones. I had to turn off the sound cause I would never sleep because the beep would awaken me every time it beeps. I can still check app or notifications so that alright for me. This will make it also faster to see how big it was if things start to shake rattle or roll!","5"
"619","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I haven't tried the pro version it the basic version is pretty interesting. The list of cities is pretty comprehensive. The information given for each city that has had a recent quake is also comprehensive. It's definitely an interesting app with interesting read. The app functions pretty smoothly. Overall I'm happy with it.","5"
"620","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Had another quake app, but was continually updated that it got to the point where I wasn't receiving the proper earthquake updates, saw this app and downloaded and within 10min I was receiving the recent earthquake information of the quake that had happened. It is quick and love the details about it! Should have gotten it years ago.","4"
"621","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Transforms my iPhone into a super know it all device that's spot on with information, didn't know there were so many earthquakes occurring but with this app, all the information arrives almost instantly, great job and highly recommended. Two thumbs easy up!!!","5"
"622","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I've used this app for my research on the earthquakes and their affect. It has a very clean interface and lets you know about earthquakes depending on the area you are in. It has a superb source of information from all over the world. Really appreciate the app and the concept.","5"
"623","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I actually wasn't  expecting such a great app! This app exceeds expectations for am earthquake tracker, and is really easy to use. Simple design  scheme, and easy to understand at first use. Has a map with points of recent earthquakes, and also displays magnitude and location.","5"
"624","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Easy way to see what earthquakes are happening around. There are a lot that go unreported on the news and we probably never feel, less than 2 on the Richter scale. Cool to see when and where they all happen.","5"
"625","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The region settings don't seem to work. I told the app to only notify me of events local to me, and got notifications from all over the world. Then i tried setting it to North America only and still get worldwide notifications. I guess the only way to prevent it from notifying me of events I'm not interested in is to delete the app, so that's just what I did.","3"
"626","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It gives you what an email subscription to USGS would give, but in a condensed way.  The map doesn't use the whole screen so is very small and the settings have too big letters, sometimes over imposing... But it works and it's 8.3MB of memory.","5"
"627","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I like this app for tracking earth quakes around the world. I feel that I am kept informed and up to date on all quakes. They keep having small quakes within 500 miles of me and this app lets me know they happen with in minutes.","5"
"628","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I would like to see a general -all quakes map when recents happen and you go to app to look at them. Also tsunami warnings attached to quakes that happen.","5"
"629","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I been using this app for quite long now and it's awesome the notifications are very fast and precisely. Please guys don't dare to give up on this app it's amazing. If you can make some more animation to it will be the even better...thanks guys keep it up.","5"
"630","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I love this simple app. It is the only earthquake app that lets me know seconds after I feel it. Better than did you feel it on the web though that's a great one too!  A must for Californians","5"
"631","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I look at this before I look at the news in the mornings. We can cause all sorts of crazy up top, but if our rock below our feet isn't stable then we are certainly doomed. This app makes one appreciate the land they walk on.","5"
"632","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Good app, but I don't know all of the little towns where I live. It would be nice if the app derived my smartphone's location and figured out how far the earthquake occurred from where I am right now. Now THAT I'd like to know. My dog freaks out either way...","5"
"633","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This is a pretty great app. I've been having to look online when earthquakes happen in Chile. Now, I have something that will allow me to keep updated on my family. Thank you for such a great app.","5"
"634","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app is very informative and useful for anyone who has ever experienced an earthquake. I would recommend all my friends to have this app so that next time a tsunami comes they will be ready for it.","5"
"635","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Great list of recent earthquakes. Customizable magnitude so little quakes don't overwhelm you (unless you want them to!). Separate magnitude for issuing alerts for the large quakes which might affect family.  It does what it says and gives you a sense of the active geology of the Earth.","4"
"636","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I had just finished writing a rather lengthy rating for this app. When I finished, I hit the send button and it told me my user name was taken and erased everything I had written! So now I will rate it one star.  The app does not report all quakes. I was reading the news about a 5.9 quake in Malaysia. I looked at the app and it was not shown!  I have the notification setting set at 5. Smaller quakes reported but not this one. I will look for an app I can trust","1"
"637","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","We have been in Italy since the big august quake, and continue to experience some of Italy's strongest quakes in the last 100 years.   The app Has been so Helpful in helping us understand all that is going on","5"
"638","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app is great. Provides all information on earthquakes. I'm not sure if it issues notifications when an earthquake is about to happen but that would be great too.","5"
"639","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Just shows you recent earthquakes from around the world. Very simple and there's no one trying to get me to buy anything!","5"
"640","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This is a one-stop shop for an earthquake app.  Has everything you could possibly need. There's no reason to look anywhere else.  Save yourself the time.","5"
"641","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app could be life saving some day. Extremely interesting cause you can even read about minor earth quakes that one will never hear about.","5"
"642","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I like this app, it lets me know about quakes all over the world..so far nothing serious, but I keep watch. I wish the maps were bigger, since I don't always know the whereabouts of a country just by name...🤔","4"
"643","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I live in earthquake country (California). I got this app to check out s shaker I experienced last year. Since then I have really enjoyed having updates and a quick notice on what's happening around me and elsewhere in the world. Very informative.","4"
"644","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Best app updates info about earthquakes  But sometimes late info and late notifications  Need new alert sounds to select than i only I give 5 stars","5"
"645","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The events around the globe make it a good to have Ap. Tells where the world is making change and you can also see what oil fracking and oil drilling is doing. Keep up the good work.","5"
"646","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I absolutely love this app  I do wish tho that it had a part where i could select different areas for itto alert me on instead of just around where i live","5"

"649","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Ive tried about 10 quake apps and this ones become my favorite. Very informative and simple- with all the right filters to see what you want to see.","5"
"650","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app sends me notifications from all over...usually 4-9 hrs after the fact. What I really only want to, see is quakes within a certain distance near me over a certain magnitude. I does not matter what my setting preferences are, I still get notifications from areas I am not interested in seeing 😕","2"
"651","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app is great for seeing the small tremors and the big shakes. And the notifications are super helpful. Wish there was a way to search for a location by typing its name.","5"
"652","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I never realized how many earthquakes there are every day! This could very well save lives. I love that you can customize your notifications in settings.","5"
"653","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I get high anxiety when I feel an earthquake especially living in California. Your app is useful, so I know where it's centered & can alert friends & family.","5"

"655","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app is nicely designed in every aspect. Clean and easy to use. Most importantly it does what it says and it just works. Cool to check this out wherever I'm travelling in the U.S.","5"
"656","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It's a good app. I live in Oklahoma where there are frequent quakes. Sometimes just randomly it won't show a quake for several hours.","5"
"657","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Everything is fine but when I start to open the app always there to zoom in California. I prefer to see my local zone.   Needs to use in Spanish language. Thanks.","4"
"658","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I tried many and this one seems to deliver faster notifications, I can react sooner. Thanks","5"
"659","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app is very great, because it says the location before an earthquake or tremors may occur, it is perfect to be prevented, also has an original and clean design","5"
"660","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","A brilliant neatly designed App that helps me stay on top of the latest news. When it comes to checking about earthquakes, my go-to App.","5"

"670","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","The main page is kind of confusing for me and not easy to figure out how to use. But after getting used to it, it is pretty nice as the earthquake info is pretty comprehensive, that's what I am looking for.","3"
"671","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I am happy with results of this app. I keep it on the world wide alerts , as it seems to work best on that . I am finding it accurate & with immediate results😊👍","5"

"674","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I live in Alaska where we get quakes all the time. Just had the worst one I've ever experienced and this app sent a notification about an hour afterward, and still doesn't have the right info even if you open the app. It's never timely and almost never correct.  This app is garbage.","1"
"675","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app lets You know when an earthquake takes place. And the App is easy to set to Your own preferences","5"
"676","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It's great how you can filter the notifications by magnitude. I used to live in LA, and if you were notified every time a baby quake occurred you'd never look away from your phone!","4"

"700","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It might sound weird, but I have been so engaged in it. It’s teaching me a lot. And it has a great design. Complements to the developers!","5"

"715","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Generally good but I don't like the blast of alerts all happening at 5:00 AM, as-if it's making-up for missed alerting.  If it doesn't alert as they happen, there's no point in telling me at 5-AM.","3"
"716","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","It's great that this app is accessible to blind people using voiceover. I do wish that it was easier to get to the MMI information as that is the way to examine earthquakes in this modern era. The Richter scale is so 1985.","4"

"724","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Recommend for anyone living in California","5"

"984","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I started using this app on an Android phone. I paid for the premium version, way back then, circa 2011. In 2017, I switched to an iPhone. This app has been great and I finally paid for the Pro version last week. I wish I had, in the beginning, in 2017 because the app is working so much better now. I have only one complaint and it’s the limited notification sounds. Would love to have access to a Temple Bell or Ships Bell sound. Also, question for the developer: If some jerk-country drops a nuke somewhere, will this app alert?","5"
"985","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Thanks for the earthquake App. & all the reports on earthquakes. Elgin’s SC is very close to us (Loris, SC 29569) Thanks for all your information.   Edwin L Strickland","5"

"989","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","This app is great but with a potential down fall.  It is reported to have access to your calendar and to your contacts! This is the last time i am using it. I won’t recommend an app with such weird behavior. In the jrustonapps.com doesn’t specifically says it but a cyber security software report it as accessing calendar and contacts.  No thanks!","1"

I was just a little girl but I remember it well !   This time I am let’s say much older and I was terrified !!! This sight has helped me know if I thought I felt an quake I was right !   My kids call and make sure I am ok and then take me to their house in Eagle River ! Thanks for all the updates it helps !","5"

"994","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","I don’t understand it.  how it really hurts to do any research!!! Because on July 4 2019, I live in Kern County Southern California United States. And we have been riddled with major and minor earthquakes all day yet trying to backlog and look at my security cameras to see if I can find anything on it to publish and this UTC time frame is really messing with my mind. It’s like it’s predicting the future. It would be nice if the developers could do something about this to make it my time and not U WANA C??? Figured out for yourself please make the app more user-friendly to those that are good with math and do not understand UTC","2"
"995","My Earthquake Alerts & Feed","Got this app because we keep having after shocks, since the big 7.0 earthquake.  Very neat options for map view and alert sounds. Stay safe everyone. Dont run outside. 😊","5"

"1","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I’ve been using various earthquake-notification apps for a few years now. This is the only one I’ve found that actually picks up all the earthquakes near me. We have a lot of small rumblings in northern Nevada/California, and this app gets even the 1.0’s. Other apps didn’t even get all the 4.0’s. This app makes it easy to see the quakes around me; I don’t have to pick them out of a long list of places around the world or U.S. The map is attractive; detailed enough to see rivers & roads to narrow location; and I like the circle (62-mi) delineation/highlight. The list view is convenient for seeing recent events’ details too.","5"
"2","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This earthquake map is an awesome app with a lot of options and it’s free. It has current updates daily and is faster than my other earthquake app that I have as a reports come out immediately where are my other earthquake app comes out after this app reports earthquakes! I recommend this app to anybody who is interested in knowing about earthquakes and also they put on the map nuclear power plantsAnd other objects as well. You can use the Settings easily to change the map and the app to what you’d like to see.","5"
"3","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I felt a mild “bump” not a shake, wondered what caused it. Right away came the info, a smaller number than I suspected. I was grateful that no damage was done, which was why the intensity was low even though I definitely felt it, it was closer than most. I watch the very low intensity quakes, a lot of them lately, wondering what causes them. I’m in a low fault zone so not concerned about a “big one”.

"4","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Living on a volcanic island, I need a flexible and accurate app to know about virtually every kind of natural disaster.  For years, this has been my preferred app, but now I’ve had to find another.  My favorite feature was the ability to set up zones/distances.  For example, any quake within a few kilometers, any 3+ on my island, and any 6+ in the Pacific (tsunami threat).  The reason I’m leaving.  The user interface for everything I can think of is cluttered, non-intuitive, and can overwhelm.  This became extra obvious when I suffered an eye injury and the app doesn’t follow the iOS settings for dark mode and font sizes.  Even if there is a setting somewhere, I had no way to find it.  So my complaints and suggestions are:  - Reconsider virtually everything about the primary screens and setting screens, and look to simplify and streamline. - Obey the iOS accessibility settings.  I’ll check back in a year.","2"
"5","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","A wealth of information for us couch geologists. The Premium price is a bargain. Started my subscription just now. The only downside (albeit minor) is that I feel the earthquake list screen is visually overwhelming and should have a cleaner interface. Also, the font size is a tad small for my 60-year-young eyes. Finally, a Watch complication would be nice. Otherwise, highly recommended.","5"
"6","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Living on the W. Coast and close to the ocean is not without it’s dangers. Waves arrive endlessly. With that being said having fair warning gives us a chance to head for higher ground with this app. It is a requirement we have for our safety and the safety of others who don’t have this app. The big one poises a threat and is predicted to come at anytime, this app. should be in everyone’s phone. Thank you. des","5"
"7","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This app is very helpful and informative to keep you in the know about Earthquakes when and where they happen, especially those closer to home. Easy to setup your preferences for notifications and to view those areas where you live and may travel to for such occurrences. It’s good to know!","5"
"8","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I liked this app and used it for years. But, lately it is useless. When big quakes happen, the server usually returns no results for several hours until things quiet down. It is also missing a large 7.0 quake from only 5 days ago. Yes, my filter is set correctly and the quake is showing on other apps as well as the reporting database. It is time to move on for me.","3"
"9","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Hey Slava,  Things aren’t correct again, premium feature defaults to the subscription page. The notifications aren’t working. I lowered the settings mag 1 to match other quake apps, they notify, this one doesn’t. I live with eartquakes on a daily basis in Alaska. I felt a 3.4m in Big Lake as of writing this, didn’t notify me🧐  Thanks","5"
"10","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I lIke your reports BUT they would be so much more descriptive IF you would show them on a world map!  My radar pro used to display all of the daily earthquakes with a red dot on the ‘globe’ of their location.  That is much more definitive if one can actually see their location in relationship to others all over the world!","4"
"11","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I have added many blue stars on the map. I found instructions to add but not to delete. Could you add a little note, maybe in the instruction to add “my place”, mention how to delete stars?  Otherwise. I am learning so much from this app. The tutorials are great. Definitions of terminology,  geographic lines by color and what they mean. The list goes on and on.   I’m learning about oceans and islands I never knew existed (geography was not my strong suit). I find a new land mass, pull it up Google Earth to look at what if anything is there and read information about the island or group of islands.   I love this app. Just help me delete all those blue stars, please.   Threat stuff.","4"
"12","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","We have tried many aps. We find the information to be accurate and updates immediately following an event.  This one allows us to keep our settings because they don’t default when ap is closed.  User friendly.","5"
"13","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Very useful for following earthquake swarms as they approach my area on the East Rift. Delighted that the Ads are at the bottom and do not block vital information. The only downside is updates can be very sluggish in low bandwidth area such as ours, especially when the cell tower networks are carrying a much heavier load due to this ongoing emergency.","5"
"14","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I have found it very interesting to see the earthquake activity in certain places. Having gone to college in Santa Cruz, California, lived on the Alaskan Peninsula and now reside in Central Idaho earthquakes have become a common place occurrence. I can go to the app and within a few minutes see where and how strong the quake was!","5"
"15","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I am most disappointed that, having entered locations where important people in my life are found, the information seems to yield nothing.   I appreciate that the list of earthquakes seems accurate, but most programs give me that. I haven't found any features that impressed me. It is a good app, but not great.   I'm willing to be proven wrong.","4"
"16","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I give you five stars as the service provided by this Earthquake and Tsunami app is the most complete and which notifies very carefully when the earthquake originates .  Primium service is excellent .  Thank you for providing such essential and important service .","5"
"17","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I love the app, it provides timely and great event info.   Better than free apps used in the past.  I think a tutorial of sorts is needed in order to better understand what all the app can do.  For me it has been a matter of trial and error for set up and feature discovery.","5"
"18","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Now I can’t see earthquakes what I am in trouble I can see everywhere including different places. I like this app if I’m in trouble and I also like another tsunami button also, I love this app I want to have it forever. 😀","5"
"19","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Living in the Pacific Northwest, it’s a matter of when not if. This site keeps me informed of earthquakes worldwide which in someways affects the entire planet. The info provided is awesome, stats, times , etc. it’s just a really informative website.","5"
"20","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I love this app.  It takes a couple/few minutes to update and get information on quakes, but it’s informative and there are many, many  options to customize the app to your preference.  I love this app.","5"
"21","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Great app, very detailed with information such as Miles and not just Kilometers, use of the flags helps you spot your area quicker or other countries a lot quicker. Sends through alerts in minutes of the quake happening.","5"
"22","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This is probably one of the best apps out there. I really like the alerts. I have mine on for greater than 5m.  However, the alert will go off and it usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes before the earthquake shows up on the app.","5"
"23","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This app is a good evidence of where and when earthquakes happen. I quite enjoy it. It could be improved by adding a brighter bar between today’s quakes and yesterday’s and previous days quakes. I fine the gray bed hard to spot as I scroll through the data.","4"
"24","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I find reading the list of earthquakes hard on the eyes because you’re coloring ea. One and it makes it harder on the eyes to spot where (location) is. Ie. Spain is one color, south seas another  My other apps have all quakes listed same color and once you examine ea. One they apply particulars there.","3"
"25","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I purchased a years subscription and the google ads won’t stop. I uninstalled and installed then restored purchase and it crashes and won’t open.    Disappointed.  Update: in addition to the above issues   I now get a pop up window that says “Server did not return results.  Check your internet connection.”  But I can check tsunami results that uses the internet to bring up the website for current tsunami activity.","1"
"26","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This app is very informative and provides timely alerts, detailed information, and has excellent resources.  I recommend the standard or paid version for anyone that is interested in the science of plate tectonics.","5"
"27","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I had recently downloaded a couple of different apps and was disappointed with both. I then found this one and a couple others and downloaded them all to compare. This one is the very best out there. I love it!","5"
"28","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Recently paid a one year subscription in full   Came to the app to check on an earthquake felt in PERU   To my surprise, the app is frozen and fixated on a region of Japan     Or does not matter which earthquake you choose to click on  in order to find information about it .....  the result is the same,  the map and the info provided is always “Japan “      Wrote to “feedback” in the app but so far I have been “ignored”  Terrible app   Terrible customer service","5"
"29","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Living in Washington state, I like seeing what has hit around us. We have our bug out bag ready to go for when larger ones hit. I use the info from this app to watch for earthquake swarms which might indicate bigger movement coming.","5"
"30","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I installed this app and set it up but never get any notifications. When I open the app I see info about all the quakes. It would be great if it would notify you. All my other quake apps notify me.","5"
"31","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","When the earthquakes hit here we were notified about 10 minutes later. I thought that was pretty fast.","5"
"32","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Was doin really awesome but something is wrong with app when click on the eq. Part it gives me a weird message about checking the filter but everything is just the way it’s been set since day one so looked for an email add but couldn’t find one so leavin a review","4"
"33","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I use it all the time being that I live in earthquake territory.  I don’t like being forced to give a survey in order to make modifications on my paid premium service!","5"
"34","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Since we are NOW witnessing the alarming frequency of earthquakes around the Ring of Fire, it’s a wise idea to prepare your *go bag* which includes this awesome app! Be ready for the big one or least see it on this interactive map!","5"
"35","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","The app is pretty accurate and real-time but could certainly be cheaper for an annual subscription due to how much money overall each app makes you pay. It adds up.","4"
"36","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","While I am still learning the options for this app I do like that I can select areas of interest.. set alarm notifications .. see the active areas  It is user friendly I would give this app 5 stars but I am still learning the options","4"
"37","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This app is great. I live within vibration distance of the New Madrid fault line. When I think I feel a tremor it is nice to open the app and see what is going on. It is satisfying to confirm nothing is going on in my area. Cool information. 👍","5"
"38","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I can get limited information with the app, but its enough.  When i really want the whole picture, i check on the computer.  Glad you provide this service.","4"

"40","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Way to expensive to keep informed ! I understand paying for the app, but this is public information needed for safety!","5"
"41","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I’m a curious onlooker and a resident in an area with a lot of small earthquakes and I decided to track what I sensed. I like the filters, map options and lists on this app. You can even choose a time span.","5"
"42","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This app is perfect for narrowing your search area for quakes to near where you reside. I don't need to know about quakes in Alaska & CA since I live on the east coast. I monitor those in the overall app & set my region for all the smaller ones in New England! Top Notch!!","5"
"43","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Love this app as one can also choose the distance, which can also be seen on their map, for the information one may desire.","5"
"44","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This app is one of the best ones because it tells you where the earthquake is and what is the high to low it is because I started using the app when I had big earthquakes in Idaho and felt it I knew I needed a safety net and this app was it","4"
"45","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This is the best app I’ve found! Lived in California most of my 67 years. Yes, I’ve felt many earthquakes and this App doesn’t disappoint! Thank you developers for a fine app!","5"
"46","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Like the app. Have been having quakes in our region like never before. Nice to pin point the location of the occurrence. Thank-you so much for the app.","5"
"47","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","this app alerts me before my other maps by minutes of quakes","5"
"48","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","As one would expect from a top notch serious govt. agency (last few years just a bad dream, hopefully in the rear view mirror in mere DAYS!!) an all encompassing great piece of work.","5"
"49","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Looking for REAL EQ data?  This one has it all!  USGS has been limiting their data feeds for years now and the only way to get MUCH of this data is to use this app..  Feeds from all over the world, collated with precise multi-viewed mapping capabilities already integrated, so no more swapping around different programs and keying data!  Even if you aren’t a ‘serious’ researcher, but still enjoy FULL and ACCURATE data, this is the one...  I’ve tried ALL of them..","5"
"50","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This app sends notifications 8 - 12 hours after the quake or aftershock has happened. That much of a delay is not useful to me. There are websites than can give me the information within minutes of any activity.  It’s much quicker and easier for me to look up the info rather than wait for a notification 8 hours later.","1"
"51","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Hey Steve  Earthquake+ isn’t sending out notifications when quakes occur. Volcano’s is working like a champ. I love both of the apps. The earthquake app was really handy in Afghanistan.  Keep up the great work.  Brad Mules","5"
"52","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This APP not only shows the size, but maps for location","5"
"53","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I live in Hawaii where an active volcano erupted in 2018. This app is great but the sharing to social media option needs improvements.","5"
"54","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Like singling out states country’s. I would like to not have to go through all the world, but just spastic area’s","5"
"55","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","The top program I go to for detailed information. Better than Earthquake 3D.  The only program I found that access all the monitors other than just USGS or EMC","5"
"56","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This app is very easy to use. It is pretty accurate. It uses many sources which is perfect. I do think that it could be a bit more detailed though in certain places. But other than that it’s great!","4"
"57","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","It's a great program but too slow to notify you of an event. Most of the times, 10 minutes or more from actual event to report time. Needs to improve.","4"
"58","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","You are not showing the volcanic fields and volcanoes in the Continental U.S.A., or allowing us to see the multitude of swarms east of San Diego, CA without paying for the upgrade.","5"
"59","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Very useful to get information about an earthquake after it happens.","5"

"66","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This is an excellent app!  My only suggestion is to make the past track of a  storm more visible, so guessing at the future track Is easier.","5"
"67","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Love the app as it kept up to date on all the earthquake in North America and it updated within a minute of me feeling an earthquake!  This is amazing!","5"
"68","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I love the app, but I live in Mexico City and we just had earthquake alarms to go off about a half an hour ago, and the app is still not showing up there was an earthquake. Quicker information turnaround might be a good thing.","4"
"69","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","It keeps me aware of the quakes around the areas that are most important to me in matter of seconds of happening.","5"
"70","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Congratulations! You’ve found an app that doesn’t even test on iOS before marketing! I sure would like to see the pretty map like the description shows, but it crashes even under default settings when I click to view it - only the list screen works.  DELETE!","1"

"77","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I still need to get acquainted with this app for the usage of it so far. I really like that you can see all the little cities and roads on a map if you’re near the area of an Earthquake or Volcano! Very nice also as a back up for maps. Thank you.","3"

"92","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","After downloading several apps this one stayed. They are efficient any any app that has a server that handles the Ridgecrest quakes as well as this does deserves a 5+ rating. MAY 16, 2020. THE CANADIAN QUAKE HAD FELT REPORTS. WHY WAS IT TAKEN DOWN?","5"
"93","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Okay since the app insists I rate it honestly it isn’t that great. Couple times it shows no data at all won’t retrieve it. It doesn’t have the rings or depth pins like earthquake 3d and doesn’t have options to set it up personable. Just doesn’t have many options at all","2"
"94","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I loved this app until the recent upgrade changed everything that was good about it and triggered a security warning on my iPhone.

"418","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Hi","5"
"419","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Ok","2"
"420","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","My kids live in Hawaii which really isn't more than a few big rocks in the ocean.  I can see if there are any major earthquakes that have potential for tsunami.  I don't like the warning systems over (at least on the Big Island) the sirens only blare when the tsunami is a warning and not a watch.  The Hilo side has many people that do not always have the ability to jump up and get to higher ground.  Generally when the sirens go off, the panic begins.  Stores and gas stations are packed and traffic is heavy to get to higher ground. Most people do not understand that the Indonesia tsunami went 20-30 miles inland.  There needs to be much more public education on what to do.  When I see a quake that is big enough to cause a wave then I let family and friends know and keep them informed throughout the day.","5"
"421","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I definitely like this app since it is customizable and informative while not ad-infested. The functions that are limited to those who pay are not necessary to the point where functionality of the app is hindered, but also not remote enough that the features wouldn't be welcomed if bought. Which I feel is a nice balance that is hard to achieve when you need money to support further development while also not alienating the users by limiting the base functionality of an app by requiring payment or by inserting invasive ads at every opportunity.  10/10, would recommend to anyone who wants to have up-to-date info on earthquakes in their area or around the world","5"
"422","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I really find this interesting.  It takes feeds from many different agencies so that is better than other phone ones. the USGS software has changed and the website is no longer valuable. THEY decided people didn't need to know the lower mag. Earthquakes so they just stopped showing them. (Government response to people worried about fracking? ) I increased my area coverage to most of So Cal you can see the quakes along San Andreas and other local faults.  You can turn off the sound to the notifications which is good.  When I think about it I might buy the upgrade.","5"
"423","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","As a geologist I appreciate accurate, timely geologic information. The versatility of this app, seismic activity, tsunamis, volcanic activity--all put in context with the option of displaying plate boundaries and such forth--make this a very comprehensive resource that's straight forward to interpret and easy to use. My initial inexperience with the interface led me to ask for help, and it was very quickly provided. I opted to upgrade to get the most functionality and feel that the price was well worth the benefit. All around, a fine job. Elegant work!","5"
"424","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This app is fraught with bugs starting with the free upgrade. I could find no way to do the upgrade, so emailed the developer and they DID answer. But the screenshot sent does not look like anything I have.. Additionally if I try to BUY an upgrade, it asks me if I want to buy the entire package? I say NO, and nothing happens after that. It appears I can't spend money even if I want to.  Going back to the App Store, iTunes has no idea that OzQuake doesn't even know it's already installed and wants to do it again, but even with a fresh load you can not upgrade anything. There is allot of possibilities with this app but it's still broke and needs allot of background work.","3"
"425","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","The recent Napa quake woke me up at my house in Sacramento, and I immediately went on this app to find out where/what happened (after the shaking stopped, obviously). The app already had the information fully available, not even 60 seconds following the earthquake. I love the maps, the quake listing is extensive, and it's very user-friendly. I highly recommend this app if you like checking in on earthquakes around the globe.","5"
"426","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","It is a very useful app that tells you about earthquakes, but it has a very annoying feature, it constantly pops up an alert if there are any quakes happening and won't let you view the list of quakes due to the alerts are displayed in both a banner style notification and an alert style notification ( which is impossible according to notification settings) making it so you are having to press the ok button a million times for each quake before you can view heist, and then assuming there are after shocks (which all quakes have) you will have to press he ok button again for each after shock registered. If there are no quakes for more than 10 then and only then will you be able to view the list.     The app does not have a way t change the alert messages and/or is ignoring the Notification Center preferences!!!  Please fix that   If it is fixed then I will give the app a 5 star rating","2"
"427","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","And run for my kids room, under cover..  A couple minutes later my ipad lights up and I get a push notification of the exact details of the quake. I can easily scan for aftershocks. I either go to bed feeling a bit more calm or I wait for more if the earthquake was a bit long and dicey. It's one of those great apps that when you need it, it provides a ton of value.","5"
"428","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I have family members around the world, and some are in earthquake prone regions. It is good to be able to easily see if an earthquake I have heard about is actually near where a family member lives. For example, my brother is in Japan, but I don't know much about the different areas in Japan so I can use this app to see exactly where a quake occurred in relation to where he lives.","5"
"429","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This is a cool app with current right on the spot Quake information. other apps maybe several hours or a day or so before they knowledge there is a quake. This app gives you the location and the size of earthquake right in just a few minutes, very cool. When an earthquake hits nearby, i like to know where it was and big it was. this is an app for me.   It would be nice to have a fire app also.","5"
"430","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Living in Hawaii, working for the State of Hawaii Civil Defense and the Department of Emergency Management for the City & County of Honolulu, you really do need the fastest alerts possible while living in the middle of the Ring of Fire. Tsunamis in Hawaii is a constant and yearly threat that can happen at a moments notice. Why not have the best tool on your personal phone and your work phone? It just made sense to me and it's accurate too!","5"
"431","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I love this app because it is easy to use and you can set up regions of interest.  My family lives far from where I am, I set an option to let me know when there is an earthquake in that area.  When has happened I am able to see the epicenter, strength and allows me to call to make sure everyone is ok at home","5"
"432","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This is the best earthquake info/monitoring app that I've found, and I was happy to buy the in-app Bonus Pack to support the developer.   Two suggestions to improve the UX:  (1) It would be really nice to be able to use it in landscape mode on the iPad, especially for users who use their iPads in a case with an external keyboard.    (2) Please add a way to access the settings from the screen that lists recent earthquakes, rather than forcing the user to have to go to map view first.  Perhaps a gear icon?  With the swarm of earthquakes recently in L.A., this has been a great app to use to keep up to date with what is going on, and the push notifications are great.   Keep up the good work!","5"
"433","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I use a few different earthquake apps. I like this one the best for location based alerting. Other apps have predefined geographies which is nice on a global scale, but this app lets me pinpoint a central location and choose a radius I'm interested in.   It also reports on small quakes. Many others only allow for >2.5 but this one reports as small as 1.0 for free.","5"
"434","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Since moving to SoCal 3 years ago I had always been worried about earthquakes... A neighbor told me about this app so I downloaded it right away! Needless to say I use it everyday and even if it's not near us, it is nice to have a heads up to call family and friends to check in them.   Love the app and def recommend that you use it too.","5"
"435","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This app is a great way to stay aware of earthquakes happening around the world as we slide closer towards our inevitable demise. You can even see nuclear plants in the affected zones, so you can be the first to rush towards the radiation cloud to benefit from its transformative powers.  The main improvement I would like to see: Draw a shape on the map for a selection area to monitor (instead of the default circle selection).","4"
"436","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Have used app since it came out.  Like the way to see where in world earthquakes occur by going to map option..  Only complaint, is that on Apple Watch seem to get earthquakes notifications at same time in morning.  Don't know how as unsure of when notifications occur or just earthquakes occur at same time all over the planet.","5"
"437","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","(FYI: I chose a 5 star rating, bcuz I'm just a new user on this app. I doubt if I'd re-rate it to a lower # of stars, bcuz of the reviews I read b4 I chose this one) After reading ALL the positive reviews, I feel this app will live up to its user's expectations...time will tell, & in the meantime, I'm glad that consumer comments are shown, as I rely on this info to help me make a better educated decision. Ty","5"
"438","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","When I go to the list and see all the small and medium(1-5) worldwide,  it seems that 1 out 10 are often within 50 miles of home in Cook Inlet Alaska. Most are less than 3 and deep in the earth and I never feel them. Several small quakes are better than large ones so I guess it is reassuring","5"
"439","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","As a member of Department of Emergency Management and the Hawaii State Civil Defense, I require the fastest notification possible and with this app using 7 agencies instead of just USGS, it saves our members time by eliminating the verification process and helps us to get our warnings out in a more timely manner to prevent loss of life and property with the added response times from this app.","5"
"440","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I have this and UbAlert. I always get the alerts from UbAlert hours before this earthquake app. I'm not sure why this app is so far behind? That's why I only gave it a four.  However, I like this app for the map feature which gives a nice overview of all earthquake activity within the last few days to see a pattern especially around the ring of fire. That's very useful.","4"
"441","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This has been a good app, with quick updates and an easily accessed map. However, since the latest iOS update the app will open, begin to load, then close itself, and is completely unusable. Hoping the glitches get worked out soon.","5"
"442","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I paid the 99 cents to be able to change the notification from 1 to 4 on magnitude. Now it wants to charge me again to change mag again.  Could add up.  Other than that it does update you depending on mag.  Update: user error.  The 1.99 extra charge to format is worth it.","5"
"443","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","If you enjoy science, you will enjoy this app. Love the map feature! The map is great, but I wish the map would be able to encompass the entire layout at once on my ipad. A nice addition would be to have the ability to select an earthquake and have the option to be redirected to news stories pertaining to that specific quake.","4"
"444","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This app does a great job of bringing in multiple feeds. I would really like to see the fault zones and plate boundary lines named and active to touch...over all great app!!  App update... June 30th, they added the earthquake fault zone names and updated how the map interacts with the different feeds.. thank you so much by far the best earthquake app on the market!!","5"
"445","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I LIKE this app, simple to use with great information about earthquakes from all over the whole world. One touch to see all the latest earthquake locations, times and earthquake magnitudes. The FREE app includes the option to see earthquake locations on a map.  This app is SHAKING up the competition like it's no one's FAULT.","5"
"446","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Good, up-to-date information with automatic notification of quakes in your area. But you can also look at current activity all over the world. I never knew there were so many quakes and many of them repeat in the same area!","5"
"447","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","A very useful app for those who live or have family in seismic active areas, or simply are interested in Earth Science. Paid version has alert filters that are very handy. Otherwise even a minor quake in one of listed areas of interest triggers an alert.","5"
"448","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Once stopped going straight to map,found the convenience of scroll back in time to event,then going  to map. Surprised to find satellite photos were more up to date than any other app I have.","5"
"449","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I love this app. It never lets me down.  Every day without fail, I get at least one notification that an earthquake has occurred somewhere in the world.  Earthquakes occur daily, globally, and I get notified of all of them, big and small.  I would highly recommend this app.  Keep up the good work!!","5"
"450","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Living in earthquake country, this is a much needed tool to have. I have it set to watch Oklahoma where all my family live. They rock & roll more than California!!!  The only thing I would like to see added to this app is the option to rotate with my iPad.  I highly recommend this app;-)","5"
"451","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I have several weather apps but this one has become my go to app I like the temperature highlighted in read when the app is closed, the overall look of the app is appealing and I like that it changes to your current location. Great job!","5"
"452","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Traveling worldwide and living in CA, as someone said in previous comment, it's nice to know if what you are experiencing is a small earthquake or a large truck driving by.  I actually experienced a minor quake in Taipei today and was able to open this app and see that it was a 5.6 rumble.","5"
"453","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I really like this app. It sends me notifications of earthquakes  within 660 miles. Since we live in Arizona, we're constantly receiving them because of being so close to the west coast line. Hard to believe there are so many earthquakes that occur so often.","5"
"454","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I find this app to pinpoint the fires and earthquakes pretty good. However it didn't show one today in California another app and news did which was disappointing. But hopefully they will do some tweaking and it will do better.","5"
"455","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Its incredible you have information in timely manner as it is available seconds after every event also world wide information... Very useful app I love it!!! Valuable information in minutes","5"
"456","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Can't customize anything without paying at least .99 - auto set to only show quakes 4.0 and above, auto set to listing world wide quakes rather than opening with map of a desired location, etc...and it won't let you customize anything. Nothing in the basic app with incentive enough to motivate me to pay .99 for an upgrade....","3"
"457","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Recent 'terremoto' in Central Italy gave me concern for relatives in Blera, Manziana and Viterbo (80 or so miles from epicenter).  This app helped me infer there were little to no effects in those areas.  The filters help narrow down quakes and aftershocks in various ways, including geographical area, intensity, etc.  well done!","5"
"458","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Today my niece wore a humorous Stop Plate Tectonics t shirt.  So much happens here beyond our control and even beyond our awareness. Always more to learn...and marvel at the Creator's kindness in preserving mankind despite the destruction man has caused through the millennia. I appreciate being able to know where and what's currently shaking and how strong. Nice work.","4"
"459","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I've tried so many of these apps and this is the only one that's proved to be reliable after many months. Also, it posts recent quakes really fast- often before my local news apps do.","5"
"460","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This is a nice app and does what it says it can do. I like that you can filter according to how severe the earthquakes were. And often you can see that there are quakes happening around the world that you would otherwise not know about, as they're not reported in the news unless there's a major quake","4"
"461","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","love this app. It's completely user-friendly. I especially like how you can filter quakes based on size, distance from you, etc. Have never had any issues with the app, no failures or disconnects-- it's a great tool.","5"
"462","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","nice quality But it does Not show the volcano info or Nuclear info as promised 6 in app purchases available but not very specific on that info ether does have small ad at bottom I can deal with that but they said No ads :-/  I was willing to give a try with only 7 ratings but now I think I might pass ? I'll give it a week and see how good it is.","3"
"463","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Great App providing a comprehensive world view of Plate Tectonic activity.

"465","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I have been notified within 30 minutes of each earthquake in Kansas and Oklahoma (my selected area for notifications).  I now know if friends and relatives are impacted and how strong it was.","5"
"466","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I especially like the map with color coated tags and the fault lines. Just recently started to use this App to decide where I would or would not want to travel. So fat it has been quite useful","5"
"467","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I use this app always, keeping it on 24-7 to monitor fires and earthquakes especially with the recent rash of wildfires and spike of CA tremors, it is also very accurate and easy to use, keep up the great job!","5"
"468","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Amazing!. I never dreamed there were that many earthquakes occurring and with what frequency. This app let's me know as much or as little as I want. Also, as I discover places on the map I never knew about I go read about them.","5"
"469","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","And that's what I wanted last week when it felt like my 2014 car was shimmying and making a low rumble on starting. Is that maybe...an earthquake? Or my car? I searched right then for an app to answer my questions. I...wanna know.","5"
"470","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Well done, accurate and easy to use. Finally I know I am not crazy living in California when I think I feel an earthquake - and -will get a notification from the app saying that I was correct! Really cool app all across the board!","5"
"471","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This app has plenty of options for the average user. Also, best customer service I've seen. They gave me suggestions as how to use the app, and I was therefore able to get to exactly what I wanted. I recommend it to all.","5"
"472","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","Was thinking about how awesome it would be if there was an app that did EXACTLY this, searched for it and well no kidding here it is. Earthquake notifications for your particular map settings usually come in ~ after the earthquake","5"

"535","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","I would love to customize the app a bit more without paying. But for a general use app, this is helpful, especially since we can get 4-10 quakes locally per day.","4"
"536","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","This is an accurate and very up to date map/data on the earth's tectonic activity.  Highly recommend.","5"

Por último, es una aplicación libre de costo lo cual la hace accesible a todas las personas y es por eso también que la hace meritoria de las 5  estrellas.   Les doy las gracias al desarrollador y a todos los que la hicieron posible.","5"

My wife and I felt the 4.4 earthquake on the Rogers Creek fault; it was 2 miles north of Center of Santa Rosa with depth of only 1.6 miles. That may account for why we felt it plus why NOAA  published a tsunami report immediately after the earthquake. All of the information reported on this EQ app site is highly appreciated. Information is easy to read. Mabs associated with the area easy to read and interpret. Additionally we know people in Petaluma and they said they had a one minute advance warning (that the earthquake was going to happen) from the recently established early warning system. all of this information is highly appreciated.","5"

"1230","Earthquake+ Alerts Map & Info","email sent to developer:  I just got done comparing your earthquake list with a query I did on the USGS website for all quakes 3.9+ between 2014-09-11 00:00:00 and 2014-09-18 23:59:59.  I am sorry to report that your results include quakes not found on the government site (phantom?) as well as discrepancies in the magnitudes shown.  Please feel free to notify me when your results are more accurate AND the app is able to display in landscape mode. -------------  One nice feature is that the app will send you to the USGS website for further info on a quake BUT it appears as about .5 size font on my iPhone 4s, which is unreadable!","1"
"1","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It's an interesting app that helps to keep me informed on what the earth is doing. I have noticed that I often do not get an earthquake notice for about 30 minutes after it has occurred so you certainly don't want to rely on this app to save your life or give you real-time forewarning. It is useful though, especially if you pay close attention- you can see how an earthquake in one region will stimulate an earthquake in an almost opposite region. In this way, it can help you predict what may happen next.  Update: I liked the app much better before it was updated. Before, the map was a satellite image and I could zoom in and explore the topography of the ocean floor and such. Now it’s just a cartoon image. I still gets alerts but I use the app much less now because of the crumby map. And thanks for the adding the ads...  I upped my rating back to 5 stars for the developers quick and helpful response and showing me how to get my satellite image back. Thx:)","5"
"2","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","While the information it provides is indeed accurate, the app's reliability as an emergency notification system is highly questionable. The main issue with this app is its inconsistency in delivering timely notifications. This unreliability can be detrimental during critical situations when every second counts. On the positive side, when Emergency Alert does manage to send notifications, the information provided is accurate and helpful. Additionally, the user interface is clean and easy to navigate. However, these positives are overshadowed by the app's unreliability in delivering notifications. In emergency situations, users need a dependable system that they can rely on without any doubts. Unfortunately, Emergency Alert fails to meet this crucial requirement. In conclusion, while Emergency Alert provides accurate information during emergencies, its unreliability as an emergency notification system severely impacts its usefulness. Until the app addresses its notification delivery issues, it cannot be relied upon as a reliable emergency alert app.  To developer: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ for your response.","2"
"3","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Our world is experiencing all types of challenges that people are still not even beginning to understand.  We all have not considered the reality that our earth is not a dead rock, but every bit as alive no less than our heavens, oceans, animals humans, insects and biology in all ways. Some events have suffered in horrific unimaginable events, as we are seeing almost daily.  Our earth is very alive and humanity needs to understand this! Quake Feed is but one source that we all can wake up to and understand earth shifts and turns and continents move about as the world changes axis’s. Weather extremes, with flooding and fire and volcanic activity and melting ice are all life in change.  I love this app for it is teaching us about all forms of life within this earth. This app is educational for all people who listen, look and truly accept learning about earth movements and continue change.","5"
"4","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live near Portland, OR, and am wary of the big 9+ event happening along the Cascadia Subduction zone, or even the 7+ event that could happen along Mt Hood. Granted no one knows if Cascadia will just break loose without warning but I’d like to think there will be lots of tremors before it goes. This app is great for seeing fault behavior on a day to day basis around the world, if you’re so inclined to observe in that way. I get alerts that I customized based on distance from you, region, and magnitude. A 3.0 earthquake happened in Sumatra? I don’t care. A 7.5 magnitude happens in the same place? I’d like to know.  That said this app does not present real time data. It’s typically 15 minutes or so after the event. If I had a perceptible quake in my area, I’d feel it and then 15 minutes later the alert pops up. Oh gee, thanks. So it is not a usable warning technology. I’m sure that would depend on the use of better GPS sensors right on the faults themselves, which hopefully we’ll have in place one day.","4"
"5","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I learned about QuakeFeed when radio legend Art Bell raved about it one night, and immediately added it to my arsenal of essential earth changes apps. Getting alerts in real time is vital for everyone because quakes can happen anywhere, anytime, and this app delivers. I not only monitor my own region but importantly, that of my friends' in the often shaky Los Angeles area. It's a bargain to buy the full version for a very nominal fee for the features you get, and the developers deserve every penny. They have configured fascinating world map details with fault lines, pinpoints for  quakes with magnitudes, and even mark major fires across the U.S.  They generously helped me with an issue when I was a free user so they support their product all the way. Anyone who is interested in earth sciences, the quickening, or just staying safe needs QuakeFeed!","5"
"6","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I downloaded this app and configured my alerts only to receive an alert for Mexico not even five minutes later. I don't live near Mexico and it was not a part of my alert settings that I configured. When I went back in to change the notification settings I received multiple errors saying the app couldn't connect to the notification server. I tried multiple times and when I did finally get in there was a new notification configured that I didn't set up. When I tried to delete it it said the same thing about not being able to connect to the notification server. The ads were unexpected to just show up after I clicked on something and pretty annoying to have to wait five seconds to get to what I clicked on. One extra star because I could limit my notification to only the state I live in. But ultimately this app doesn't work. And maybe given more than 10 minutes this app would work, but I had it set up and something happened to make it not work.","2"
"7","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Addicted to QUAKEFEED! Completely “OVER THE MOON” with the many features of this APP!  QUAKEFEED has immediate USGS Govt  EARTHQUAKE & TSUNAMI warnings, with “direct links to the USGS reporting site” for more information. Countries, Regions, & States are programmable to “a QUAKES intensity, multiple strengths/magnitudes”, with text Notifications if you want them. QUAKEFEED has a NEWS link for the latest information, good graphics & choice of map display, including the “Ring of Fire”. The QF APP is easy to read, program and understand. The Magnitude QUAKE levels, includes time, “distance from my location and depth of QUAKE”, city & state...  Very Accurate!

"8","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have been using this app. for years and have not been disappointed. I love science and this app. lets me gather information about the movement of the earth's plates. To see how the movement of one plate will effect another. I believe you will find this app. very helpful and if you have children a great resource. Love how you can set features to your own level of notifications. How you can sort through all the quakes by intensity and change back and forth between the list and the map. Update! I hate the map now. Hard to read and the list is too big. Now only a few visible on the screen at one time. Too much scrolling. Looks too cartoon like. The colors are awful. Very disappointed for me, not an improvement. Was easy to look at the map and know what’s was going on but not now. Not going to recommend it to anyone any more. Not all “Changes are improvements”.","3"
"9","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have been using QuakeFeed for about 5 years now. I started using it when I saw an ad for it and thought, what a novel idea. I probably don’t know how to use every feature but what I do use works perfectly every time. It has never crashed and never failed to give plenty of details about every quake on earth.   I have mine set to alert me to any quake 6.0 or higher. All number it gives out are true except those in the states. But I believe the USGS downplays all US quakes by .3 to make them sound lighter than the actual. That happens regularly. Example, QuakeFeed alerts me to a 7.4 in Alaska, ten minutes later the USGS says it was a 7.1, so thats all I can say about that.   Please keep up the good work. And Thank you for a great product","5"
"10","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Really preferred previous version of map.

Downloaded this app after earthquake in San Francisco Bay Area near where I worked to be kept informed.  Was even more fascinated then when all earthquakes could be pinpointed on the maps and shown in relation to California on the rim of fire. Was helpful in seeing location of earthquake in Turkey in relationship to where some family members were located in southern Armenia. Liked being able to participate and say if I felt an earthquake in California, though only used once, but still if we sense some motion check to see if it’s an earthquake. Great app, but don’t care for the new map.","5"
"11","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love to look at this app ! Always interested in earthquakes and as Nother app user said something is making many more happen around the world ? Is it global warming , HARRP ,or just what our earth does every so many years ? Wish this app would talk little more bout that but overall I love it look at it everyday even tho in Indiana where I live we don't have many ? But one question is that we do have a fault line near us the New Madrid n has caused some quakes since I've been alive but nothing bad . But in many years b4 this fault has caused some very large ones ! Just wondered why this fault isn't on map ? Other than that I love this app & would recommend anyone with interest in quakes defiantly get it !!!! Ty for all the great info!!!!!","5"
"12","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live in Southcentral Alaska, site of the strongest (9.2) earthquake in North America, second only to the 9.5 Chilean earthquake of 1960.  Anyone living along the Ring of Fire should have an earthquake app for safety.  You can customize alerts any way you want- by magnitude, distance, date, etc, so you won’t be alerted for events that don’t interest you.  My feedback is for the “Erupting Volcanos” feature.   While a little red pyramid is fine for active (rather than dormant or extinct) volcanoes, it would be helpful to have more information, at a glance, on the volcanoes which are actively erupting.    For example, the Las Palmas (Canary Islands) volcano is in the midst of a violent, destructive eruption, but the icon is no different than hundreds of other active volcanos.   Maybe active volcanoes could have a green icon and erupting ones red or something.  Also, there could be a blurb of current information when one clicks on the icon, other than to simply give its size, coordinates, and a link. Basic information about the current eruption could be on the info page, the same as with earthquakes, without having to click on a web URL","5"
"13","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I question the accuracy. I was i Naples Italy when an earthquake happened around 4am, was told a 4.0+ by media outlets on the 27th Oct 2023. This earthquake disrupted the train schedule and no trains ran until the lines were checked. I know because I was at the train station and my travel plans were crushed.  Anyway, the app gave me no notification about this, nor was not registered in the app. I checked for weeks puzzled. Then I checked about a month later and it showed up, but with incorrect or non correlating information. They had it registered as happening on the Oct 26 at around 6pm ish. The information is incorrect and I now question the validity.  I still like the app and it’s cool to check out what’s happening but the accuracy and timing I now question. I feel it’s more of a novalty.","4"
"14","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","When the ground shakes and friends and family are at risk, this app is usually sending me timely, accurate and dependable information. I have known of major quakes within minutes and been on the phone warning my friends in Crescent City, California and Hawaii that they need to get ready to evacuate to higher ground to avoid tsunami waves that threaten their lives and property.    I know that when the ground quakes and the seas roar I will be ahead of 99.9%+ of the world with the facts.     When events require an emergency response and I'm not personally there I have QuakeFeed to give me fast accurate data I can depend on!    A must-have if you and your family or your business and finances are affected by the Act Of GOD known as a major EARTHQUAKE!","5"
"15","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This App has to be one of the best in its class for reporting seismic action around the globe. It is easy to use and delivers great reporting immediately after the event. Its filters allow the user multiple ways to sort and view the data. There is a varied assortment of maps and with ease one can scroll around the area affected by the earthquake making it a fun and attractive App to use. Best in its class. I recommend adding the ability to sort three ways; and, more ways to choose an area and save the configuration for monitoring.    One request: I cannot read the light color small print please make it black or white","5"
"16","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I used to really like Quakefeed as a quick, reliable emergency alert source for quake information & notifications (does that well still), but they've more recently decided to add ANNOYING popup, full-page advertisements that blocks access to critical features and setting options -- even putting up an open option that is masking a hyperlink to the stupid ad's company page.  It then forces you to SHUTDOWN the app and RE-START it to get the info or settings you originally wanted to use...oh, and CLOSE the IRRITATING hyperlinked ad page popping up on our browsers, too! Just wholly engineered DETOUR programming!  Maybe it is a way to get us app users to buy the upgrade to their AD-FREE Premium App Service, but pulling this kind of online BOTTLE-NECKING of its emergency information is NOT an effective way to convince us CONSUMERS for their premium app! Tsk, tsk...","3"
"17","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a great informative application, even if you are or aren’t extremely interested in active volcanoes or wild fires.  This is a great tool for tracking, learning about where, when and severity of the increasingly frequent geological activities around the world.  All of the volcanoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis and wildfires are shown on an easy to use interface and can send you warnings if you are in a place where you could be in danger.  This is a great application and is worth the yearly subscription price.  The only thing I wish they could add to the app is some sort of winter storm tracking.  No matter what, very great application to have!","5"
"18","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","**Will update my review after using fixed features. Thank you to the developers for fixing my favorite earthquake app in the Apple store and replying to my updated review. The ads appear to be gone again for paid subscribers.** I cannot select a choice to refresh or look for my paid subscription. There’s only a choice to purchase another one. Wish the paid option gave me more data and all notifications didn’t disappear after clicking on only 1 new notification, because then you have no idea what the other notifications were.","5"
"19","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app works well and does exactly what I want and need for it to do: immediately inform me of an earthquake and provide the information of an event, including size, depth and location. Living in an area that has frequent earthquakes, this informative app actually provides a greater degree of comfort, less fear, because of the push notifications alerts. Additionally, it allows me to automatically learn about earthquakes in other parts of the world and lets me learn that earthquakes are happening frequently in many places and regions and not exclusively where I live. The app is robust in that it has never seemed to have any technical issues.","5"
"20","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have used QuakeFeed for ages and have loved it, however, all the new changes- ie: night/day, globe view, flags, etc, make it “fancy” not function. I know you have worked hard to improve it but these IMO are NOT improvements. I can no longer look at the map (now globe) and view the Ring of Fire- as the mobile view of the globe is far too small! The night view makes it very difficult to see actual locations thru all the dark & “city lights”… Sometimes SIMPLE is best! I have tried to get used to these changes, which are worsened by the space taken up at the bottom by Ads (which I understand but the map view is a bad place for them!), but unfortunately I just can’t! Perhaps following the KISS principal would help return this app to it’s former glory- at least in the case of mobile phone use! TY- from an honest oldie(!)…","2"
"21","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Quakefeed is the answer to the question - was that just an earthquake ?  I searched through many apps of this type and always came back to Quakefeed.  It’s hands down the best.  I showed it to a friend in Alaska where they have lots of activity and now they have it too and love it.  Would be great if the developer came up with more apps since they have a knack for creating.   I would definitely recommend everyone download this.  One note - I set mine to only warn me about quakes over 5.0 because every single one in the world was a little too much for me to keep track of.  Now I get notified only on the big ones 5 and over.","5"
"22","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Last night at 1:13 am my daughter ran  In my room .   MOM!! Did you feel that!! I was actually sound asleep and didn’t feel a thing..l checked my Quakefeed app immediately only to find out the epicenter for the quake was less than 1/2 a mile from my home in Hayward.. Next city over is Union City a 2.6 happened.  She said she heard the house crack.  So of course this morning l will be outside checking my foundation and outer walls.  Needless to say l did not get much sleep last night and don’t plan on it tonight either.  The quake was shallow and no aftershocks so there’s always the possibility of more quakes to come !!","5"
"23","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Ok nice app. It’s decently accurate and has an easy to use interface. But the premium advertising is a bit much… the premium practically makes it 3 apps in one. That’s a lot! Why not just make separate apps? Plus the app is called QuakeFeed. Not earthquake-wildfire-whatever comes next tracker! Also the map is kinda confusing. They give you no know-how on what the green and red lines are for. And I’m a kid with a phone, so how should I know? Overall I would recommend If you don’t really care about paying for apps or If you don’t care about seeable features having a virtual lock on them. But it’s getting late (11:00) (WHY AM I UP AT THIS TIME WRITING REVIEWS?!?!?!?!) AHHHHHHH!!!","4"
"24","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Living in the Eastern Sierra of California I have followed geologic activity for a very long time. I’ve use this app since it first came out and I can’t begin to think the developers enough. My mom is a retired registered geologist and gets excited and asks me, “what magnitude was that?!”  We have felt the majority of these recent earthquakes in California. And living in a very old structure, it’s always nice to know that we are still standing even though we had something over 4.0 🙂I highly recommend this app. It’s simple, it’s accurate, and it can tell you about earthquakes worldwide","5"
"25","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is absolutely the best earthquake app I've used and I believe I've tried most of them!  I don't currently live in an active quake zone, but still have close family and friends in Alaska, California (think San Andreas fault), Washington State (think  Cascadia fault), and New Zealand (within shaking distance of Wellington.). You could say I'm obsessed by earthquakes.   The support for this app is excellent. Questions answered and suggestions welcomed. Response time is excellent as well.   If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. Be sure to buy the Ad Free version. It's well worth the 99 cent price!  A Happy User of QuakeFeed  Survivor of Good Friday Earthquake. Me, too!!   What a day that was!!  Was 18.5 yrs old and all my family was in WA and CALIF.  They couldn’t reach me and I couldn’t reach them.   When my mother finally did get through to me (on Easter Sunday) she was just before driving up the ALCAN hwy to search for me.   Mamas are like that!  That was a LONG weekend!  Drives my interest in earthquakes to this day!!!","5"
"26","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is one to get because it gives great facts; the alerts are very accurate and is very precise. If you want to get the best feed on earth quakes this is the app for you. But their is one exception that I have to make. I live in the united state and I try to find the New Madrid seismic zone so I can see where it is located and see what states it goes through but I can't find it. It would be great if they could implement the new Madrid seismic zone so people can see where it is and what states it goes through. Over all this is a good app for anyone to use and it is a fun app to get so Hurry up and get it !","5"
"27","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Outstanding app!!! This is always up to date at the moment it happens. When the Nepal quake hit I new it was going to be bad due to its rating. This app allows us non-profits to be ahead of the rest of society to provide support readiness before anyone else. We are asked how did you know and get so prepared when it just happened? Only future upgrade I would like to see is a yearly layering option of 1, 2, 5,10, 20, 50, and 100 years if at all possible. With the option of current alerts magnitudes. This would allow some research to be done. Brutus","5"
"28","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have used this app for many years now, and it does not disappoint. Simple, straightforward, clickable, and direct linked to USGS. A very small fee makes it ad-free, and gives you extra alerts; handy if like me you live in earthquake country.  It will of course not warn you, but during the last quake we had here, it was peace of mind to know within 60 seconds (while quake was still going) where the epicenter was, the magnitude; and a quick tap gives the type of quake and specific fault line.   If you live in quake country and want a great app, or if you are just curious; look no further, get this one.   Their support as well as their app has been consistently good over the years. No fuss, no mess.   Thank you QuakeFeed for delivering an app that has stood the test of time.   PS: To those curious, I believe I first installed it in -13. So long ago it is hard to remember. Either way I’ve had it on my devices forever.","5"
"29","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I am an earthquake geek after growing up in CA. This app helps in so many ways. I have been able to send messages to friends and family to let them know to check on their family as well! If you want learn about our changing planet this is a good place to start. You can email questions and they will try to answer you or direct you to the answer! All I can say is this will hep you know where they happen and give you the much needed information to prepare your next move!","5"
"30","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Upgraded to the full version including fire and large storms (ver 5.2.1). Very happy with the QuakeFeed application and have been using it for years. The fire descriptions should also include at a minimum State location, if not even a close city description as well. Sorting is allowed by distance size etc, but if you are checking an area of concern you may not know the fire name. Please consider adding additional location information in the fire description field for those checking to see other states maybe for family/friends safety.","4"
"31","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve used the earthquake app for a while and it’s great. I wanted to add the wildfires because I’m a Californian and we are having a problem with that. The instructions given to me by the app developer did not work. I was told to go to a link that’s not there and I wasn’t given a return email address so that I could communicate with them.  This is probably an easy problem to fix but it’s too difficult to get customer service. I’ve looked all through the purchase page as I deleted the app and re-purchased it but it still didn’t work.  I couldn’t find anything there that allowed me to contact the company.","3"
"32","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve always liked QuakeFeed, but what have you done with your maps you had in the version just before   this current version?  That map was as good, or better than Google Earth !   But now you no longer have it. Too bad .   I don’t like these new maps as much.   Another thing you should do is to list the country or island name & not the city or capital name.   That creates a lot of confusion.  Thanks .  Keep improving .   How about showing some  Mangle plume / hot spot locations .     Anyway keep up the good work !!.","5"
"33","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have been using this app for about a year and it has been very useful.  The latest release seems to have dropped the option to open map to “last location”, which makes it very annoying if I’m not interested in the “Ring of Fire” or even “my current location”.   If I want to monitor what’s happening in some area in the Caribbean (and I am not there), i’d like to zoom into into it and be able to go back the next time I open the app.  This used to work, but doesn’t anymore!  In addition, I just noticed that the map view doesn’t show a landscape view when you rotate the phone.  I remember being able to rotate the phone and take nice screenshots.","3"
"34","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This has been my go-to app for quake information.  It has information that other apps don’t and the UI has been great.  The last update improved the look of the base map, but in the process the data display suffered.  The markers are badly washed out.  The magnitude numbers are clear on yellow making them very difficult to read.  They’re a little easier to read on the red markers, but a standard black color font would be a major improvement.  Prior to the update, I was able to tap on a fault line and the name of the fault was displayed.  Now there is nothing.  I look forward to having these features back the way they were.  Keep up the great work!","3"
"35","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Just ported this App over from My iPad to my iPhone 6+ It was great on the iPad it is even better on the 6+. Would give it 10 stars if I could.   Now on my iPhone XS Max. Just upgraded to premium. Just checked I first loaded this App on August the 10th 2011.    Love the upgrade. This is the first, and only Earthquake App I have loaded.  It gives me all of the info need.  I remember when this app woke me up in the middle of the night here in Cheyenne, Wyoming and alerted me to the huge tremblers in Indonesia, and Japan. I was able to watch the tsunamis come on shore in Japan live on NHK.","5"
"36","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I checked two weeks ago on the App Store and saw that there were a lot of negative reviews to let the developers know that the app was crashing and thought that that would resolve it. Since nothing has been done I’m adding a review myself to let them know to fix the app! Love using it, before this happened I would get notifications of magnitude 5 or higher earthquakes which was fascinating!! Hopefully it will be fixed soon or else I may have to look for an alternative.","5"
"37","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live in a state that gets a dozen or so earthquakes a year. The area had a huge one back in the 1800’s, so I always want to know what’s going on around us. I like to know about big ones around the world because they can impact such large areas. However, the app information isn’t always accurate and it sometimes lists the same earthquake multiple times because it is felt a long distance from the epicenter. But that is fairly easy to sort out and I would rather thank an 8.0 hit somewhere and find out it was really a 6.5 than to not know at all. In all, it’s a great app.","4"
"38","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Not sure if it is my location or if it is not the app, but depending where you live it has a 50/50 chance to warn you of an earthquake or other land disaster... where I live there’s been several times an earthquake but it is not shown in the system. I have no way to tell how strong the quakes are but have been watching the cracks looking like it is breathing when there is a quake and its aftermath. Last time there was a big one it had to be 4.0 to show up in the system, that means that the Madrid line is being active in my area... anything less than 4 will not show so there’s no way to tell when a bigger one comes until it is too late.","3"
"39","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The filtering and notification of quakes has gotten more complicated in recent updates.  I had originally thought the ability to filter had diminished in its capabilities, but it seems it has more options, which makes it more complicated. I watched the video supplied by the app developer and after a few attempts was able to get the app to display what I wanted.  I appreciate the expanded capabilities, but I wish it were easier to configure. I continue to believe, however, that this is the best earthquake logging app I’ve seen.","4"
"40","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve had QuakeFeed for many years.  I’ve been as enthused as many reviewers until the very recent upgrade.  Now I have to verify  my premium membership every single time I go in, and often the map will just disappear.  Can’t get it back.  It seems to be when I’ve been examining the details of one quake and trying to return to  the whole map.  This is a new iPad but I’ve had to reboot to get the app to work again.  I’m done.  No doubt these are bugs they will eventually fix, but in the meantime there are now other ways to get the data without all the frustration and the big jump in price.  It used to be a great app and would have been worth the price jump.  But not this version.","2"

"43","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","After being assigned to a project in Chile, one of the countries with more earthquakes in the world and the biggest in history I find this great app. It’s good to have with you an alert for peace of mind when you are not familiar with the quakes. You can set alerts based on the intensity of the Richter scale. Tsunamis alerts when the quake is not on ground. Would be nice to activate notifications only if you’re in certain geolocation (because when I travel home I don’t want to be notified) But for me is 5 stars. Thank to the Dev team.","5"
"44","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have had this app for many years. It is amazing and I love it. It always hear about the earthquakes before they are on the news. The map shows exactly where it is. It also shows the ring of fire. And many other really great features.   I have noticed that this last year has had far more greater earthquakes than I’ve seen in the last 10 years. I usually had it set at 6.0 and for years there have been very few really. And now they are happening on a weekly basis!","5"
"45","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This feed only pulls from the USGS which is proving very unreliable... this app needs to start pulling real time info from other global agencies and countries.  Don't waste your time here as they continue to only pull from the USGS which isn't reporting all earthquakes, makes it impossible to track earthquakes if you only pull from one unreliable feed..... I will most likely delete this app!!  So I was contacted by the app developer who shared they do have other feeds other than the USGS, only problem yuh can only choose one feed at a time, they need to make it so you can use multiple feeds at once!","4"
"46","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like this app a lot and I have to say that the alert system works great. I was warned about the 7.1 mag quake that hit California before I saw anything on the news. I also like the exacting detail of each recorded quake and shock. Would be great if there was a map that showed dots for epicenters and perhaps clustering rings. With the GPS last and Kong’s that you already have, that should be an easy addition.  With clustering you could give early warnings in advance if the tremors show an outbreak or magnitude longer rising. That could help people get prepared in advance. Great app but please add the global map with plots. Thanks for developing this.","4"
"47","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Since the recent version upgrade I am much happier with QuakeFeed. The maps are improved and so are the notifications. My interest is strictly casual. I observe only as a personal interest. I had another app that was not nearly as good so I was happy to subscribe. Thank you for answering my questions about the maps. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling it but that didn’t help nor did your suggestion. When the update came out it resolved. Thank you for all your efforts to make QuakeeFeed such a good app. Linda Bartholomew - subscriber.   Sending another rating after using the new version for quite awhile now!

"49","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","No one ever thought there would be earthquakes in Kansas significant enough to startle you out of bed. But for several years we’ve been feeling them more and more. It’s nice to see what’s happening by having this app handy now. I do wish it would distinguish between Kansas and Arkansas though. I paid the extra too to be able to monitor the wildfires as I have family in California and it’s nice to know where the fires are burning in relation to where they live.","5"
"50","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I used what I thought was the best app for quake notifications for years. Then a sudden disability made me unable to see and operate that one, and I searched for another.  Not only does this app fully accommodate me while using high contrast dark mode with larger fonts, but I can’t think of a single way that this app isn’t the equal of our better than any other app of its kind.  I am beyond satisfied.","5"
"51","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Bloomfield, Missouri just had a 4.3 earthquake (actually 2 simultaneously but does not register on the map. The only proof I have is the notifications that popped up on my locked Screen. When I went to the map to view where Bloomfield Missouri is, there’s no record of them.  When I first downloaded the map a couple years ago there was evidence of New Madrid Fault. As of a few months ago, New Madrid Fault is non-exsistant. I emailed them to ask why it’s no longer on the map and he said because my settings were not set right. But they are set right.   It makes me wonder what is the USGS hiding.","2"
"52","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","QuakeFeed is one of my few favorite apps! I use it as a map too. Instant notifications of earthquakes, and any possible tsunamis link that connects you to more information like distance of warnings, watches, and more.

I would never go without it. Secnola","5"
"53","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Was the best earthquake app, but now the view is frustrating. The earthquakes are difficult to look at or search for. Totally unusable. Customer service non-existent. Edit: nope. I mean the Open Street, Topographic, and World 2D maps. I reached out to customer service. No response.  Edit: Nope. While World View 2D is a problem, I care more about Open Streets and Topographic. They are both glitchier. And I should be able to turn off territorial waters. It’s distracting and frustrating and causes problems. Why would you change that for premium subscribers?  This has not been fixed in 16.1. Customer service didn’t reply.","2"
"54","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love the new update! However, I don't like how small the little earthquake dots are. I liked how they used to look. Similar to the USGS site.  There is an option to change them to location marks, but that's too freaking big and hogs up all the map. I love the graphics love the faultlines, love the instant, well near-instant textfollow up. in my own experience when there's an earthquake it will alert 🚨 you within about two or three minutes","5"
"55","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Like a previous commenter, I need every feed available simultaneously for earthquake reports. Sometimes the USGS appears to double a notification (I guess?) unless double quakes are occurring...? Thanks developers, I hope you continue to improve the integration with other sources.  Update: thank you for YOUR feedback! I live in California and just like to see patterns...be alerted when patterns emerge. Don't know if what I'm wanting to see is specific to our region, you know?","5"
"56","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app has been working really well. It gave me all the information that I need whenever there was a shake around the globe. Even on the personal level, back in February of 2022, I was in Guatemala when a 6.2 struck the country. It send me a notification 1-2 minutes later. Obviously this app is not an early warning system but it’s really good on information about it","5"
"57","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I've been using Quake Feed since it first appeared in the App Store. I am a geophysicist and have access to numerous earthquake notification systems but tend to look to this app the most. I love the push notifications and filter features. The only thing missing is the ability to use a different sound for quake notification. I could have sworn that was possible in an earlier version, may have been a different app., still like QuakeFeed the best.","5"
"58","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Yes, the price increased a bit. A whole $4 increase per year! If that’s a problem then you likely have more important things to worry about. $5/year is a very worthwhile price. It does everything you could want from an earthquake App, extremely configurable and quick (we had a 5.2 about a year ago…the notification showed up within minutes). Very useful tool…thank you!","5"
"59","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I am really enjoying this app! The maps are spectacular, and I love how we can zoom in and out! So much information is available. It is really helpful to see the geographically active areas!  The only thing I wish is that we could see where fires are in Canada, as those fires really impact our air quality!  But, this app is still very useful! I’ve recommended it to several friends!","5"
"60","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love this app! I've tried a couple that were recommended by friends but was never completely happy with any of them. Once I found this app I shared it with everyone that used anything different. We are all happy. I have friends all over the world that I've met on Facebook. It's great to be able to know what's going down in their region. A few times I knew before they did! That was enough for them to make the  change to this app.","5"
"61","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Having a global feed of activity is fascinating to watch - got the app to have rapid information on shakers in Southern California (which worked great) but found ourselves watching events everywhere- response is surprisingly rapid and the app keeps getting better and including more features. Always have a picture of what’s happened well before any news channels report out","5"
"62","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","QuakeFeed has been reliable until the latest update (5.3) which now seems to be no longer listing the earthquakes sequentially in the feed as it was in earlier versions. Suddenly it has lost the ability to list them.  There are several apps out there for earthquake reporting. Many have fancy accessories, and some even have live tracking. The best part of QF is simple and comprehensive without being overly complex.","4"
"63","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have found myself recommending this app to several people as it is such a useful app.  Its free to use most of its earthquake features as well.  With editable earthquake alerts that often come before the earthquake hits, this app is very helpful.  With fault lines shown on the map, I find myself scrolling through the map for fun throughout the day.  Anyone interested in earthquakes in their area should get this app","5"
"64","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve been studying and trying to learn about earthquakes since the 7.1 and 6.4 Quakes hit Ridgecrest, CA in 2019. I’ve been downloading apps to tell me Earthquakes around the world but none haven’t been that good. This app tho is awesome. It’s always on top of what and where an earthquake has hit. It don’t take up any storage either. Anyways all I wanna say is it’s a great app and it’s perfect if your trying to learn more or study about earthquakes.","5"
"65","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Ive had this app for at least 8 years. It has improved greatly since then. I have had a break from using it for a while, but would open it every now and then. Ive used it more recently since more activity has been happening with volcanoes and earthquakes. It’s very accurate and reliable on warnings. I really enjoyed having the hurricane tracking. Great app. 😊","5"
"66","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I got this app because I live in California. But even when I’ve lived elsewhere it’s come in handy. I often find myself referring to it during conversations and when I’m curious about what’s happening below us. The tectonic plates are moving and this app, with a bunch of useful features, helps me see what’s going on around the world to help prepare me for what’s to eventually come my way.","5"
"67","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve had this app for years. It used to have no ads, but now it does and they want an auto-renewing 99¢ per year to turn off.  Just felt an earthquake and didn’t get my usual notification that it happened. Logged into the app and it had turned off notifications.  Turns out if you update iOS (I did the iOS 11 upgrade) it turns OFF notifications. Ugh. Well it is back on, but if you get this app be sure to occasionally log back in to make sure it is working.  I wish this app had a report button and a chat forum for folks to talk about any earthquakes they felt. I think it would be useful.   I would love to see the developers take a NGO approach and get funding to make the best EarthQuake detection app and work to get it built into or bundled with phones as a public subsidized service.","4"
"68","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Probably one of the worse ways to get notifications about earthquakes. Always sends information about wrong region or distance although I had specified how far out I would like to get with regards to earthquake events. Notifications are very random and scattered. Notifications are late or sometimes never show. Customized Notifications settings doesn't work and if it does it sends the wrong notification. The data for my region has old data and didn’t even pick up the earthquake that happened a few hours ago with magnitude 4+ Not worth a download👎🏻👎🏻 They have most definitely paid people to write fake reviews.","1"
"69","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have been using this app for a few years now and have learned a lot about the nature and activity of earthquakes. I love the maps and all the configurable settings which make for a informative and very useful tool. I live in Southern California and I consider this as a must have app that just keeps getting better all the time.","5"
"70","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It would be great if it was a little more user friendly. For instance, it should zoom to your location automatically. Also it would be nice to have more filter options when you’re looking at the Quake Map. Like the option to only see earthquakes in the last 24 hours, last 48 hours, last week, etc. you can’t tell when each earthquake happened when looking at the map, so that feature would make it a lot easier to navigate. Other than that, it’s a pretty good app.","3"
"71","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","As a resident in California, I really like the Fire mapping.    As a suggestion for enhancements, it would help to change the color of either the symbol and/or the area covered when the fire is 100% contained, so that at a glance we can access what areas are completely safe again. I suggest either a green symbol (indicating safe) or black (suggesting charcoal or arrested).  But it's really helpful not to hunt for a state's fire map.","5"
"72","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It takes a little while to get your settings adjusted perfectly -- to decide just how many warnings you really want to receive, because there are HUNDREDS, so you need to hone it down to what you actually want to receive -- but once you decide what warnings you do want, it will do exactly that!  And you can still keep your map settings to show them all, if you just have the need to know it all! 😊","5"
"73","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The features have dramatically changed in both usability and graphics.  When I get a message that there has been an earthquake in an area that I am interested in, I used to be able to click on the alert and it would take me directly to the site on the map.  Now, it takes me to a list of all earthquakes and I have to scan down the page and try to find it.  When you do get to the map, it is so cluttered with larger bubbles, it’s almost impossible to see which one is current.  I’ll keep this app a little longer, but I will be looking for a new one.","2"
"74","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It's wonderful to have an app on your phone that at the touch of a button will give you information however you want it. If you travel like I'm doing now it will adjust and give you information from your current location, which is nice. It tells me how many miles away it is, how deep it is, and warns of possible tsunamis. It's just faster than having to login to the USGS. Great app!!","5"
"75","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great app to keep up on latest and ever changing earth conditions with earthquakes and wildfires.  Live in Southern California and knowledge of both important. Great to see quakes pinpointed and nearby areas that may be affected. App has great information with websites referenced for further info. Would love a possible website reference to updates on tsunami generated and areas affected. (It could be there and I have not found.)","5"
"76","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","When I first heard about this app, I thought it would just be a toy or gimmick. It has turned out to be extremely relevant and important - from knowing whether my clients and employees are safe in Mexico after the series of earthquakes there, to gauging whether the seismic disturbances in North Korea and Iran might be nuclear tests – it has proved to be surprisingly important. I have also been impressed by it thorough and detailed with mapping and geologic context.","5"
"77","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","So far I like this app better than most earthquake apps. But I am tired of apps constantly trying to force upgrades in order to use them. Following wildfires should NOT be considered a premium service! COME ON!!! Charge to remove the ads—SURE! But blocking us from emergency information… come on now!  I’ll see how it goes to determine if I continue with this app or not. Let’s hope it improves soon, because I would appreciate finding a reliable app ASAP!","3"
"78","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","QuakeFeed is a great app.  Been using for quite a while now and I like how you can choose the strength of quake you want for your alerts.  I live in an active quake area and I like that I learn of a quake in my area immediately, before the tv or radio.  It also tells you the distance the epicenter is from where you are or your home base. I also have set up for alerts for large scale earthquakes throughout the world.","5"
"79","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a great app that is very adjustable for particular preferences. Want to know only about the big ones you can do that and get push notifications. If you want to follow fracking related quakes or see where swarms as low as 1.0 and up are occurring you can modify notifications by size, date, distance. I really like this app living next to the San Andreas fault.","5"
"80","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","As a Californian and first responder, this app is tremendous for a variety of incident types. I mainly use it for wildfires and quakes. I set the range to 800 miles from location unless I’m out of state, than set for all. I had a question to support and within 24 hours I received my answer in a helpful and friendly manner.   This is one my top apps I use for disasters. Highly recommended.","5"
"81","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","There are now many earthquake apps out there and I’ve tried most of them, but this one gets my vote.  This app is quick to respond to quakes. You can sort quakes by depth, magnitude and date. The map comes in several different styles and shows fault lines. The developers are very responsive. It’s the complete package and clearly worthy of a 5 star rating.","5"
"82","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","A must have for those who like to know the up to the second tectonic shifts happening in their local area and around the world. You’re able to filter by magnitude, date, earthquake size, and distance from you. The earth is constantly moving and this is the means of seeing the shift as they happen","5"
"83","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","We have friends and family all over the world who live in earthquake-prone areas. It’s nice to be able to check where an earthquake has occurred (when in the news), and find out how close to the people we love. It has relieves stress at times when we realize an earthquake in Japan, for example, is far away from our friends there.","5"
"84","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I really like this app. I think the addition of fire activity & weather are nice features.  I miss being able to view the map data in the landscape view. That option seems to have been removed.  If it hasn’t can I get information on how to see the map in landscape view?","5"
"85","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I experimented with the free version for a few days then spent $1.99 for the upgraded version. I really like the upgraded configuration options though it would be useful if the tsunami alerts and earthquake notifications made a more obnoxious, distinct alarm rather than the same ding I hear for a text message from my Mom. Highly recommended.","5"
"86","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is one of very few apps I pay for.  It helps that the subscription is very affordable - less than $5/year - but I would even pay more because it is so useful.  Here in southern Oregon, I have been using it many times a day to keep track of a fire only 7 miles from my home.  It has been better than the county emergency services website. Thank you for helping to keep me safe.","4"
"87","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have used this app for years and for the most part really like it — good filters and choice of feed.  BUT, I have noticed when there is a big quake, it has a high probability to NOT show ANY quake data.  Turkey had a 7+ earthquake last night, but QuakeFeed showed zero quakes world wide.  This morning there was another 7+ quake in Turkey, but still zero quakes being shown world wide.  I have other quake apps that I don’t like as well, but at least they are working.","3"
"88","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app blows my mind. For very little, I became a subscriber, and I’m so pleased that I did. The depth of information and insights as well as terrific visuals are very helpful to my understanding of the way the earth moves as well as what is happening with wildfires and other changes due to climate change. It better helps me understand my responsibilities as a global citizen. Thank you, QuakeFeed!","5"
"89","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I am afraid of earthquakes, there are so many fragile pieces of ceramic and porcelain in the house, china cabinets and hard to find crystal pieces that one big earthquake, they might break and then be worth nothing, and that’s what I fear, that some force of nature could take away my inheritance just like that, because then what? I wouldn’t have anything of value and then what would I become?","5"
"90","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","it has a different tone than my other app notifications so when I hear it I jump to find my phone to see where any quake larger than 6.0 happened. You can easily choose your own quake notification parameters in tools. I am also in coastal Oregon and watching for signs of anything unusual that could cause Cascadia Sub Zone to blow.","5"
"91","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live in a very earthquake and wildfire-prone area (Southern California) and this app has helped me find out about earthquakes for quite some time now. There’s no (intrusive/annoying) ads, it’s very to the point and easy to use. It’s an incredibly useful tool if you live in an earthquake-prone area, or are curious about/interested in earthquakes and wildfires!","5"
"92","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I just want to say this is an amazing app the amount of information you can get is more than l ever thought I was going to get Where l live we have had some bad quakes and it really helps to know if an earthquake just shook the house or not and how big they are I really appreciate the effort the app is giving Thanks  PS- Totally didn't know that the earth has as many fairly big quakes as it does crazy","5"
"93","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is informative as to where earthquakes are happening. It provides all the information one wants to know plus more.  It gives the depth, strength, location, and even has a the option to filter and show location a map, or in a list. Perfect tool for anyone and simple to use.","5"
"94","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","UPDATE:  Problem is now fixed.  The app is now giving an error when I try to set notifications. States something is wrong with the settings and ask to reset to default. Select yes and get another error. Caught in an loop and cannot get out of it. Please fix this or I will have to delete the app due to notifications needs to be adjusted.","4"
"95","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I appreciate knowing what is going on the the world. Thanks to the developers who have spent so much time and energy on this app. I have used it for years for just earthquakes. This app now has information on fires and hurricanes. I can’t wait to start looking at that information in addition to the premium features at such a reasonable price.","5"
"96","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Hi, I just found your app because I’m living in Puerto Rico and we are having a lot of earthquakes here. I noticed the alerts notification are 1 hour later . I don’t know if you could help me to fix this issue. In example , the notification reported that it’s just happened an earthquake 1 minute or 2 ago but the time that the event happened was an hour ago. I don’t know if it’s because Puerto Rico didn’t change to summer time like Florida . If you could help to understand, I really appreciate.","3"
"97","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have the free version, and find it is easy to navigate, accurate, and prompt with providing updates. Living in Alaska, we get a fair amount of shakes, and it’s nice to see where they were and how large fairly quickly after they occur. I also really like the notifications for the big ones worldwide (I’ve filtered notifications to only alert for 6.0 and up.) 👍","4"
"98","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Living in California this app is a must. I like the fact that I can have alerts sent from various miles from my location, since some earthquakes travel far. I also like I can receive notifications from around the world for very large earthquakes.","5"
"99","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Too many earthquakes overload the feed and it doesn’t update for 10 minutes or more... when earthquakes come only every few minutes, it seems to work fine. Love the filters for range and amplitude. Still trying out all the features. When will it warn me of upcoming quake? All I see are seconds to minutes after the shock...","5"
"100","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Easy to use, simple to customize and very informative.  I like having the app in Southern CA and being able to monitor the region and it has always been first before the news so a little extra time in terms of notice.  The best app for what it does and we monitor all areas that can affect us including Australia, New Zealand and Japan for early warning to Tsunami activity.  I recommend the app highly.","5"
"101","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","QuakeFeed is “Star Trek” type atmosphere on the entire planet. A 6.8 earthquake anywhere on the planet will cause damage. Some 20K+ casualties. But, getting notified of a 6.8 earthquake on QuakeFeed has guaranteed mass destruction on tomorrow’s news. It also indicates underground military explosions activities in the centers of areas north of Siberia. Like. 7.0 earthquake there with “zero” post news coverage of any kind. I love QuakeFeed. TY so VM.","5"
"102","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is simple to understand and navigate through. Love the fact that it will alert me by sound within seconds of an earthquake near or in locations that I have chosen to set up. As more and more earthquakes are occurring over the entire planet, it would benefit everyone to have this app!","5"
"103","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live at 17.9 North, 66.7 West. Check it out with this app. It has been tremendously useful on a day to day basis, with 12 to 40 tremors of magnitude 3.0 and above in a day, to make decisions about living under these conditions. I wish I could set the location of my home in a permanent fashion and have the option of reports relative to the home location, in addition to my current location.","5"
"104","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Am currently living on the Big Island during a lava event. There have been thousands of eq’s since this event began in late April 2018. It has been interesting to see the location of the quakes which appear on the list in a short time period. It is useful in tracking the lava flow as it moves from Kilauea to the ocean. I love the global quake map. Easy to see where world wide eq activity has occurred during this world quake event.  Linda Bruce Pahoa, HI","5"
"105","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Outstanding app!! Am greatly concerned to see the Ring of Fire so active, but at the same time am far more on top of things than I would be without the input this app provides; we live in Southern California, and have every reason to believe our big one is coming, and our own preparedness is increasing daily. Thank you so much, you who have provided this for us; I am deeply grateful!!🌺","5"
"106","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Earth will have more earthquakes as time goes on. They can be scary, powerful, and fascinating. I like this app and have it set to notify me of 6.0 and higher. Having experienced a long 5.6 quake in Mexico City in 1964, and living in New Jersey and Utah, I like to track quakes where my friends and family live, and where I have traveled, and this app lets me do this.    Weickh","5"
"107","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Why does the USGS not report all quakes, I mean come on man quakes going off all over the canary island, volcano going off and possible tsunami could happen and head for the east coast of the US and not a thing from the USGS….what are they hiding! Fortunately we know and are spreading the word. I mean really! 2/6/23 many 4and 5s going off in western Turkey and you don’t even show them?","5"
"108","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I enjoy this app and depend on it since I live close to part of the ring of fire and some pretty big volcanoes. I wish it would let us get notifications for smaller quakes without paying however for 6.0's or bigger, this seems to be the most accurate and the fastest of the several I've tried!","5"
"109","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have a fascination with earthquakes and this app feeds it. The Premium is definitely worth the subscription. With the inclusion of wildfires, it is very helpful with my living near New Mexico and getting the smoke into our area from the them. The Developer has added many other cool features, that I'm still delving into.","5"
"110","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","When I first downloaded this a couple years ago it seemed to be accurate and would update pretty quick. Lately I’ve noticed it takes much longer for activity to post to the app. What really disappoints me is there was an earthquake, 4.2 in Utah near my daughter. She felt it and asked me to see what the app said about where it originated and how strong it was. Well it’s been over 24 hours and the app still doesn’t show it. It’s too bad because it used to be a good tool with good information. I’ll be looking for a new app.","2"
"111","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app had been great! Whenever I feel the Earth shake, I can always rely on the Quakefeed tone to chime within 5 minutes following the tremor. It's very interesting looking at the map to see the activity, especially after a large quake (like the 7.2 that vibrated instead of rolled through).  Thanks for the great info, Quakefeed!","5"
"112","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The good points: Interesting data on local quakes. Having grown up and spent most of my life on the New Madrid fault, I track Oklahoma, Kansas & Missouri from 2.0 and up. Once configured it's easy to use. I have the app set to automatically notify me of quakes within 200 miles.   The cons: When the app updates all settings are reset to default which is very annoying causing me to have to manually reconfigure the app every time.","4"
"113","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","even though the US GS constantly removes earthquakes or downgrades them, this app consistently misses the earthquakes in Georgia. For example, July 12 and Varnell, Georgia. We had a 2.0 earthquake that remained unreported. I have sent several examples to them with absolutely no reply. There is no way to turn off this new illustration of wildfire smoke. The ability to turn off wildfire reporting should be under the settings, not under the earthquake reporting calibration. This app is as an accurate as the US GS but not as nefarious as to why they exclude data, it's just a poor program","1"
"114","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live in California aka the land of earthquakes. The Hayward  Fault is very close to our house. We have small earthquakes every day and we have grown up used to that but  we have several employees from different countries and what I like about Quake Feed is if I get an alert that there was a large earthquake in one of those countries, I can ask how it effected or if it was near their families.","4"
"115","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I don’t care for the new format. The bubbles noting where the earthquakes are, are soooo big that you can see the towns/cities. If you enlarge the map to see where the current location is you can’t see where the earthquakes are in relationship to towns/cities are either. Go back to the old version. It was much more effective and user friendly.","5"
"116","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I was born and raised in California and have felt the power of a few strong quakes. I am very familiar with the Ring of Fire and the infamous San Andreas fault line. I am currently living in Illinois, but my family is in California. I wanted this app so I could be notified immediately of quakes 5.0 and above. I am very pleased and would recommend this app to anyone with similar interests. CNN","5"
"117","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is one of the first times I've never had anything negative to say about an app. I love everything about it. So many great functions and it's free. They do have a $2 app now that allows you to customize notifications more specifically to your needs--only free notifications now for 6.0 and up.","5"
"118","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","As expected, adding an unrelated issue - fires - is causing them to miss bugs in their core app. Therefore they get another star removed. My filters do not include quakes less than 4.0 yet I still received an alert for a nearby quake of 3.7. The app sent an alert yet displayed nothing when I tried to select the notification. Filter settings should apply to notifications. If you send a notification, then keep that quake in the feed even if it later downgraded.","2"
"119","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I hate most all kinds of apps. Honestly they never do what they advise unless you PAY PAY PAY.  I would pay for an app if I had the $ to buy stuff to make the app work after I get the FREE app. Ugh!  Anyways, This is everything it should be and much more. I have already recommended it to many friends & on social media. AND I NEVER DO THAT!","5"
"120","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","If you live on the west coast of the US, I’d highly rec this app. Most apps I could find were specific to monitoring one type of natural disaster, but QuakeFeed has earthquakes AND wildfires (as well as hurricanes for keeping an eye on my family out east). Grateful to now have this info all in one place versus needing to rely on multiple apps or news.","5"
"121","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I really enjoy the updates as a Californian.  Great conversation starter, too.  I follow earthquakes because I am waiting for Jesus’s to return, which sure looks to be soon.  Before He returns, Jesus said in Matthew 24 that “…the end is still to come…There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.”   Have you ever seen so many earthquakes greater than 6?  Like “birth pains”, the earthquakes will be stronger and more frequent.  8.2 in Alaska last week, crazy!  All the “dominoes” are in place.  The 7 years of tribulation (known as Daniel’s 70th week) are about to begin.   Accept Jesus’s death for you sins today.  Earthquakes will get worse.","5"
"122","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love this app. Easy to use and set up is a breeze. Not overly complex. Being near the ocean, and bay, this is a great tool to prepare for a possible tsunami. Living over many fault lines in the San Francisco Bay Area, everyone show use this app. Nice to know what happened immediately so one can switch to condition red when need be. Helps people handle accordingly of need be.","5"
"123","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Every time there is an earthquake close I automatically get the info on it. We have passed California in # of earthquakes per year so it’s nice to see where they are and the strength of them to see if there will be any damage it’s easier than having to look it up online.  This app helps with my ever growing interest in earth science.","5"
"124","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Keeps you up to date, enables you to see the facts for yourself, and allows you to see trends.    I use this in conjunction with a solar activity app and you can see the correlation between the two.    I’ve been using this app for years now and it’s the easiest one to use and understand.","5"
"125","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","How about being able to choose your region that you want to track instead of distance from your location. I live in Seattle and grew up Northridge (remember 94). I’d love to keep track of earthquakes in that region without having to scroll through hundreds or more because the filter you offer is only 800 mile from your location. And yes I could see them if I select any distance. But why would I waste my time searching through level 3 or greater quakes around the world to find the ones I want to see?","2"
"126","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","An ad has appeared on my Quake Feed app offering me a free trial. I cannot remove this ad. My son, who got the same ad - but on a newer, larger phone - said that the word “skip” is at the bottom of the page. As my phone is smaller, there is no room for the word “skip”. So I cannot remove the ad. And hence, I can no longer use the app. Now what?","5"
"127","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live in the SE United States, and have a daughter and her family living in Japan. Quake Feed allows me to monitor earthquakes in their area, giving this mom and grandmother, some peace of mind. If I hear about a large earthquake in Japan, I can quickly check the App to verify the location and distance from my family!","5"
"128","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have a few of these apps and I've even paid for one, but this app is the best. I like to compare information and it seems to be really accurate. I would definitely recommend it. I don't live in a highly active area. I am just fascinated with how many earthquakes we are having these days.","5"
"129","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a great app for both iPhone and iPad. Updates and alerts are timely and accurate. Great set of options to choose from. Looking forward to an upgrade with a slider bar to select min-max Magnitude and/or distance instead of the simple greater than. Get this app, see for yourself !","5"
"130","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","When you live in earthquake country, then a quick and accurate notification tool is valuable. While early warning is still not possible, a quick notice of what happened could provide some clue of what to expect next.","5"
"131","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great little app, sophisticated simple delivery of real time information about earths ever changing plate movements. If you have relatives or loved ones near quake prone areas, this should be on your phone. News networks aren't nearly quick enough when it comes to these things. Make yourself happy, get this!","5"
"132","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","QuakeFeed is so brilliantly simple to use.  From the settings, to the layout, to the concise information provided, you can’t ask for a better earthquake tracker.  I’ve also found that this app updates their information very frequently.  If your looking for a great tracker, then this is it!","5"
"133","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app is informative within seconds of an earthquake and provides relevant data with an awesome map showing fault lines. I’d love for it to display fault type and a few other geological parameters but maybe in time. The last time (2021 I think) I tried to do the “I felt it” feature it kept glitching but otherwise no issues functionally with the app.","4"
"134","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s surly interesting where earth quakes are happening. I’m shocked how many 6.+ quakes happen and seem to not be a big deal.    I live in the yellowstone area and for obvious reasons I pay attention to the many events we have here.   I like the fire addition and the new information that can be easily toggled on and off.","5"
"135","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love the app just wish the images were updated When are you updating the satellite images and why are you not reporting earthquakes that are happening in la Palma and a couple other places. And I noticed the active volcanos need to be updated missing one in Japan and a couple more.","5"
"136","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Living in California and having to go through earthquakes of all sizes, this app is perfect!! I get alerts almost immediately after the earthquake happens and it provides all the accurate information and other links to helpful websites for more info!","5"
"137","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app has increased my knowledge of the fault lines world wide. For example, I was told about a fault line in El Paso, Tx that is under the Military Hospital.  (The old Hospital). I was able to look that fault up.  If you use this app and have even a rudimentary knowledge of our Earth’s Geology it will increase your knowledge and understanding of the movement in the Earth’s Crust.","5"
"138","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is one app where, if a user writes in with a problem, the developers always answer. They not only suggest fixes, but they actually are constantly working to improve the app, fix potential bugs, and keep current with operating systems.","5"
"139","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a great app!! Recently had an earthquake in California and this app was able to quickly pick it up. Just goes to show what the Bible says is true. There are many earthquakes around the planet, some we hear about and others we can't even detect. Thanks for having this app.","5"
"140","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I enjoy using the quake map which has settings that other free apps do not allow. I would recommend this app to anybody it is so easy to use and easy to read! Unfortunately sometimes the EMSC goes down without any warning or alert which would make it beneficial!","5"
"141","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The last update messed it up it gives notifications but will no longer display on my iPad Pro... I can’t even get the screen up far enough to get the help button or email link  Update.. they fixed it and sent me a notice when they did so they get 5 stars for being so responsive","5"
"142","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app has been awesome up till now. Live in hawaii and there is an erupting volcano here now with the app letting me know when and where the earthquakes are I can get a heads up on when the volcano is getting ready to erupt. The only problem I’ve ever had is sometimes there are earthquakes in certain places that doesn’t register on here but I know the earthquake happened","4"
"143","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I downloaded 4 earthquake apps at the same time to see how well they worked. This app is being eliminated in less then 12 hours.  It is difficult to use or even figure out. Does not show a map so you can not see how close the list of earthquakes are to you. Has a button on the home page to watch more ads (who does that?). And apparently if you want an app that works better, maybe even equal to the other free apps, constantly reminds you to pay for premium.","1"
"144","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is timely with its notifications, and it’s notifications are filled with data about the location and intensity of the quakes, relevant fault lines, depth of the quakes, and much more.  In short, it provides much more than just a cursory notification that a quake has occurred at such and such place on the globe.  Excellent app.","5"
"145","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is my go to app for all seismic activity. Living in Southern California we need all the data regarding seismic activities folks can consume.   I do wish the fire side of the app was a bit more accurate but that is not an app issue, but a source data issue.   Keep up the great work!","5"
"146","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I had gotten notifications for earthquakes. I can’t Open the app without a big ad blocking the screen saying I need to pay 4.99 for the subscription. I already have the 1.99 an app purchase I don’t want to do another one for the app. Please fix this. Also that with my device I don’t have the Skip option on the app. I think it be better if you guys email me about this.","3"
"147","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Hello developers you’re the best! You’ve fixed the the bug and I can now share again with Twitter. I appreciate you so much! Even though earthquakes are a hard Mother Nature thing to live through I find I like to keep track of them and your app does that for me. I’m a life long subscriber 🌍 🌎 🌏","5"
"148","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Changes to the daylight view, making the view lighter helps a little, but personally liked this app better before they did upgrade- A few months back there were changes, it seems like it makes it harder to see where location are, it, seems like they do this to app’s to get you to upgrade & pay a monthly fee","4"
"149","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve had this app on my phone for years. It’s been great Since we have family all over the US I like to see where the earthquakes are.  But Since it’s been updated  this version is hard to see yellow on yellow for the smaller quakes. They were easier to see before. Now you have to really zoom in to see them. Color chart needs to be better!!","4"
"150","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I wish that when you zoom in on the map location that the text and other info scaled up some. Even 50% of how much you’re  ‘zooming in’ would be helpful to identify places, geo features, magnitude, etc.  Something the developers might consider for an app update.   Thanks and good work do far!","4"
"151","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Gives the essential information on quakes within a minute or so after the event. It lists facts and also shows the location on a map. Optional filters limit alerts (sound & banner) by distance & magnitude of your choice, but the app reports worldwide events.","5"
"152","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Although it does report quakes, I may as well go to the source and read about them myself because the app will not accept changes.  For example, I wanted to change the magnitude from 3.0 to 6.0, but the app would not allow me to save my change.  After I deleted and reinstalled the app, the magnitude of my local area was set to 8.0 by default.  Once again, I was unable to change it.  So, it is a novelty, but not useful for me.","3"
"153","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Loving this app and all the detail, but I’m getting an error message when I attempt to edit or delete an Regional Alerts (worldwide, Oregon, etc). It says the “push notification server” connection is bad. Then I went to your site for support and the link to the support page has an error “the community you are looking for has been retired”.  You may wanna check on this. Good luck. 📱iPhone 7, ios 11.4.1","3"
"154","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is very informative. I know about earthquakes before they are ever reported and can follow links provided for even more detailed information. It is a useful tool for those interested in geology, as it lays out and names global fault lines. I can nerd out and get lost in all of the information provided.","5"
"155","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love the you can customize your settings from magnitude to miles away. We always feel little tremors here and there and it is interesting to see them pop up on the feed. We use the free version of this app and it is exactly what we wanted.","5"
"156","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The update demoted me to a trashy add overloaded app that blocked the view on my iPhone SE. but after clicking on upgrade and clicking on “restore purchases “ it went back to a similar experience again. I was ready to dump it as it was so bad but now I’m reasonably pleased. Hope no more so called upgrades occur. I’ll keep my fingers crossed. Thanks.","4"
"157","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","QuakeFeed gives you access to all the information you need to get an accurate account of earthquakes from around the world. You can also get National Geographic Survey data as well. Quick notifications for recent events!","5"
"158","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I received an alert for a 5.0, clicked the notification and it doesn’t appear on the app’s map? This happens all the time. After spending a ridiculous amount of time, I found that there is no way to make you notification setting match your general settings…so you get notifications for EQs, but can’t see them on the map. It wasn’t always like this. I’m cancelling my subscription and looking for an alternative.","2"
"159","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have been an Apple user for over 5 years and had this app for over 4 years. This app is awesome!  Always been updated and made huge improvements. Love it!!  I am glad I picked this app after my friend suggested this app 4 years ago. I highly recommend this app for everyone!","5"
"160","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app should give you the option to put another location different from where you are. Example: right now I’m in Ohio but my house is in Puerto Rico about 6 or 7 miles from the epicenter of the earthquakes in the southern part of the island.","5"
"161","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The overall app is great but I don’t like the buggy and irritating update. The chosen distance and magnitude kicks out and has to be reset almost everyday.  Plus, it keeps asking what source I want to use and if I want to reset the source. I want the old version.","5"
"162","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like the app even that the alerts have a couple minutes delay BUT what I don’t really like is the alerts SOUND why can’t you get the alerts without sound? I like to hear the alert sound during day time but at night when you are sleeping the sound just wake you up...it’s annoying  Ive turned off the sound in my notifications, sound and still hearing the beep...I’ve looked everywhere to turn the sound OFF and I couldn’t find any option to cancel the sound in the App.","2"
"163","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","For those interested in earthquakes this is loaded with data. Won’t regret getting this app. Update, they just keep upgrading the app to make it even better. The added fire information is excellent! Important for those of us in the western states. Thanks for making a great app.","5"
"164","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app keeps me up to date with earthquakes all over the world.  I can see how the earth shifts and causes no sensation to community grief.   I am also learning where all the different fault lines lie across the globe.  I appreciate this app more insofar as if I see earthquake activity in my area, I can be more vigilant.","5"
"165","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It is very difficult to specify areas that you want to monitor. I only want to monitor the state of Alaska but instead of being able to include the whole state I have to exclude what I don’t want to monitor which is hundreds of locations. Needless to say I now have to scroll down areas that do not interest me. But I am old (78) and maybe I made a mistake somewhere and if I did I sure can’t find it.","3"
"166","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app is informative, but I don’t care for the subscription rate jumping from 1 to 5 dollars. I don’t need this information; it simply satisfied a curiosity about places I have an interest in. I can easily get most earthquake information for free via the news and other apps. I see no need to pay more especially when the service hasn’t announced any changes or additions to justify the increase. I have canceled my subscription.","3"
"167","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","After purchasing the upgrade to pro, when I go to settings and select upgrade to pro and then select restore previous purchases, only then does the app do the upgrade. I need to do this every time I use the app. The app should remember that I purchased the pro version and retain the pro version’s functions without me “upgrading” from settings each time.","3"
"168","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve used this App for years, it has been very quick to summarize locations and magnitude. It’s mapping feature gives the center when I don’t recognize the event location by name. I Highly recommend this app .","5"
"169","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","this app has great design and has many details on all things regarding earthquakes, wildfires, volcanoes, just about everything you could ask for. I love that its all presented in an easy to read manner and that it’s also all nice to look at. keep up the good work! :)","5"
"170","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love this app because I like to know what's going on in the world. I also update my family about all the catostrophes. Like Mexico was one of them. I do have some family and friends that live in the south. It's always good to be alert. It’s very accurate.","5"
"171","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have family in Japan and it’s good to know when a large quake has happened there or here in California.  When I feel an earthquake, I immediately open the app and within seconds the information appears.","5"
"172","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app pings my phone whenever there is an earthquake around the world. Living on the Pacific Rim is a shaker place - this app gives rapid information, and includes links for tsunami information with the National Weather Service. No issues with any updates in the 3 year I’ve had it on my phone. Great app.","5"
"173","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great app, but could be even better.  My suggestions are; ability to pin locations and just monitor those locations for quakes, ability to search or see quake by state, and color coding of quakes to let the user know seriousness of quake.  I will still use the app, butbit just needs a tiny bit of polishing.","4"
"174","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Extraordinary information in extraordinary times! Puerto Rico HAS suffer a record amount of quakes and still suffering now in the Southern side of the island. People are very afraid and “with good reason”.  The info about quakes comes immediately to your device. This is important cause you want to know that your family is safe.  So enough said. Get this app and stay informed.","5"
"175","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Ever since the 7.2 in anchorage, Alaska, I have started playing a guessing game on “how big is that aftershock??”. I’m writing a review after we just had a bigger earthquake(5.0) that wasn’t where l the aftershocks are happening (Big Lake, Alaska). Needless to say I’m getting good at guessing how big an earthquake is, and also freaking out about every earthquake. This app helps a lot!","5"
"176","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Whenever I get a notification, I look it up on the map to see where it is and wonder what type of affect that it has on the surrounding areas. I think it’s great to keep up with these things. And because I think one thing affects another.","5"
"177","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","All you young people will be where I am soon… One feature you could work on for phones for those of us who are older is allow the print on the map to enlarge as one enlarges the map. Right now I can’t make out 90% of the typeface…","5"
"178","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Living in Los Angeles this app is a MUST HAVE! I’ve recommended Quake Feed to all my local friends and family because it is good to have. We JUST had a little shaker (3.3) and I felt it then immediately got an update that the epicenter was less then 10 miles from where I am, great piece of mind!","5"
"179","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like knowing what’s going on around me in terms of earthquakes and this is fast. I like the maps, and you can customize the settings to only notify you of over a certain number. As an example I have my set for anything in my surrounding area over a 3.0.","5"
"180","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love watching where the earthquakes are taking place just to see where the volcanoes may start up or where a large quake might be. Just like to be knowledgeable and pay attention to our earth first and foremost. California and Hawaii are really rumbling lately along with various locations around the world. Wishing everyone a safe evening","5"
"181","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","On top of quakes 2.0 and higher since the 7.0 that we experienced on 11/30. Over 6000 aftershocks since 11/30. Granted most we don’t feel but many we do. I get an alert soon after the quake. Then the size registered. I have recommended this app to many friends and relatives not only in Alaska but the lower 48 as well.","5"
"182","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Information is interesting!  However, location descriptions are often confusing!  Though technically correct, it would be better to use the closest town or landmark!","5"
"183","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Making a home in SF comes with the reality of life on active fault lines. I love the QuakeFeed app and check it regularly to see activity both close by and around the world. It's a fascinating lens on our planet and I am always amazed when I stop and look at all the daily quakes. I find it is a welcome reminder that we exist on a dynamic, living planet.","5"
"184","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Knowing the elements will be in commotion in the days prior to Christ’s Second Coming (which is now), having this app to watch the elements increase in commotion has been greatly appreciated.  I like the ability to configure regional alerts as certain levels.  Thank you for this excellent tool.","5"
"185","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","So fed up of being forced to remove and reinstall again. I literally have to add excluded locations because this app isn’t getting it done. It’s not even one or two for my Northern California area, it’s over 100. I checked my settings and I should not be seeing this. This is absolute trash! What a joke! I will not be subscribing into another year if it’s not resolved. I upgraded to the Premium plan and yes, you were paid for the Premium. Now fix my app!","1"
"186","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I don’t just want to know where an earthquake was, but also what fault it was on & where it can lead to. Living in California, this is important to me. This app has been the best in giving me all the info both in list & map format.","5"
"187","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","QuakeFeed has a great map of recent earthquakes so when strikes somewhere in the world, you can find out where it happened. It gives notifications of earthquakes, and the depth of the quake and it shows small quakes of level 2 .","5"
"188","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve been using this app for years now and it has been very timely and accurate. Recently I have open the app and selected the recent events list from the upper left corner only to have the app completely shut down. I’m still keeping the app in the hopes that the developers are able to fix this issue.","4"
"189","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The wildfire part of the app is poorly developed and needs much work to be usable. Also, the wildfires show when looking at an earthquake in the U.S.    While both the wildfire and earthquake setting should remain active, when receiving alerts for earthquakes, the app should default on its own to only show info re earthquakes.  Also, there needs to be a default earthquake setting, even when one sets the scale for level 6.0 and above, to show the detailed info for all local earthquakes 4.0 and above that occur within a hundred mile radius of one’s home or current location.    Although a notice of such earthquakes is received, when one clicks on the notice, one only sees a notice that there are no earthquakes fitting one’s set parameter.","2"
"190","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have had QuakeFeed for several years now. Timely notifications allow me to follow trends and swarms. I use the app to supplement other sources in informing and instructing others in Emergency Preparedness programs in my community. The addition of forest fire reporting was a great addition over a year ago.","5"
"191","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love this app as it is very informative. However the only issue I have is that I wish I could read the map more clearly. Even with my glasses on, I am still squinting my eyes to view the text on the maps. Would be more helpful if the font sizing would increase when zooming in on the map.","4"
"192","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I used the free version of this app for about a year before trying the 1-week free trial. The addition of fires and hurricanes is great and I check this app almost daily for updates (which they have). The $5/year is definitely worth it!","5"
"193","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love this app, I'm enjoying reading and following it every day even when there's the slightest, I hope they fix the DUFI portion, last time it wasn't working so well.I liked the maps from previous regions better, the feed format was easier to quick check as well.","5"
"194","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like being able to configure alert levels both by region, and also by magnitude. I also like being able to drill into a specific event and see related details, including impact and potential tsunami warnings.","5"
"195","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app was handy as I live in Alaska quakes are common. However I never could get the settings quite right. I don’t care about earthquakes in New Zealand, but I would still get alerts.  Now that you are jacking the subscription from one dollar to five dollars?? Forget it.  Done with this. Bad move to get greedy & Jack up your price five fold, especially when people are hurting financially due to the lockdowns. Bad business move. Bye!!!","3"
"196","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Had some trouble getting the app to load so I removed it and reinstalled. The app does not show up as an available app but it is showing in the App Store as something I should have.  After the 4th attempt to load and delete the app it is finally back on my screen and functioning as it should.","4"
"197","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The main reason I’m giving it four stars and not five is a lack of clear notification preferences. In addition to this, the ability to test notifications to make sure they’re correctly set is absent currently and would be greatly appreciated. Other than that, the UI is a bit clunky, but nothing major.","4"
"198","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’m only interested in earthquake and related (plate and fault lines etc) info. Other info is present or planned which may of interest to others. There should be options to turn this other info off. Thanks.  edit:  ignore this. Instead, I just switched to an earthquake-only app. Thanks anyway.","4"
"199","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live at Kapoho .  My house was surrounded by lava in the last irruption. I lived through thousands of earthquakes. At that time I didn’t know about this app. I really pay attention to earthquakes. This app gives me a great sense of security because I know what’s going on and where it’s going on.    Mahalo. Dona Mueller.","5"
"200","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like that I get the most up-to-date information on this map and that it alerts me when big ones hit worldwide. I like that it lists the locations, depth and magnitude and has a wave icon to alert users if there is a tsunami warning.","5"
"201","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","QuakeFeed allows you to customize the alerts you get which could be critical when you’re traveling to or own property in a certain location, and other warning systems are either not in place or are not extensive.","5"
"202","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I downloaded this app after my state had an earthquake in 2020. I’m from Utah so it’s pretty unusual to have earthquakes here. It rattled me pretty bad. After some ptsd and 300 something tremors I needed peace of mind knowing if I was actually feeling an earthquake or not. This app is pretty accurate with tracking and times.","5"
"203","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s a great app for up-to-the-minute earthquake info from all over the world!  I really like being able to check on any quake info from where I grew up.  I gave it 5 stars for that info, for the good map setting, and especially for being non-intrusive.","5"
"204","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","My original review of 1 star remains regarding the ads. Now 5 stars for the last update. Thank you for making it easier to visualize & assess information that would affect my area. It is perfect!!  I feel it is important to give both negative and positive feedback, always!!  Job Well Done Thank You. Judy RN","5"
"205","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like the alerts, I think they could be live saving. Also, it gives you all the information about where exactly happened at what depth and the intensity. The app also explains how the plates moved; if the shake was Divergent, Convergent or Transformative. Maps are really good too!","5"
"206","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve said before I’ll say it again best app when it comes to earthquakes.  Custom alerts only made it better.  Living along the California coast knowing when a big earthquake occurs across the ocean helps with possible tsunamis.  If only you could add a possible tsunami threat alert will this make it ultimate.","5"
"207","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Know where to look because the app shows you! Get notified on quake magnitudes you set yourself. Almost real time notifications. Very cool notification sound. Great map too. Earthquakes are no joke, but I am the coolest kid in the room when the notification goes off.","5"
"208","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Works great except when you unlock your phone and push the app after it’s been a while since you’ve got the alerts. Then when you press the app it doesn’t load the alert you were to see","5"
"209","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Have used this app for a couple years now and find it to be much better than the other EQ apps I’ve tried in the past; even without paying for  upgrades. Easy to use and quite accurate","5"
"210","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love this app, and pay for the subscription. One note to the dev team: if you switch to the wildfires tab, but there are no wildfires to show, there is no way to go back to the earthquake tab without closing and reopening the app. Can you have the earthquake/wildfire tabs show even when there are no active events?","4"
"211","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","As soon as an earthquake occurs anywhere on the planet of a certain magnitude I am notified. I appreciate knowing this earth shaking information as soon as it occurs. And knowing where it is on the map. It is a necessary app to have if you live in an earthquake prone location.","5"
"212","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have seen quite a few Earthquake apps and none of them come close to being as good as this one!  This app gives you information on the quake and possible tsunami's and the maps are of great quality as well.  I would definitely recommend this app to everyone!","5"
"213","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like the app idea so I downloaded to try. Navigation of the app is easy to understand so the app is user friendly. BUT the earthquake alert I received this morning came almost 15-20 minutes AFTER we felt the seismic waves here in Tokyo, Japan. So I would say that I cannot really use this app for a warming system, it defeats the purpose if you are going receive alerts so late. I want to alert my family before it happens not after the fact.","2"
"214","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I am disappointed they took the separation between Subduction Faults, Rift Zone faults and Transverse Faults out by color and made them all look the same.  That was important to me.  I upgraded to premium hoping to get those back, but no!  This is still a good app and I will keep it to be free of ads,  but I really want those colors restored.","4"
"215","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live in Puerto Rico and since several weeks ago it’s happening something unusual here with earthquakes and in the beginning notifications appeared at the moment but since some days ago the notifications are showing way too late. Most of them you have to open the app and refresh it to show the latest if not later than that.","3"
"216","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like knowing what’s going on. I get earthquake notifications before the news talks about it. You can also see wildfires on the map. You can research current tsunami warnings due to quakes. You set the notification preferences to your liking.","5"
"217","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","We live in Alaska so are very aware of the earthquakes here! I love this app showing all new the globe, helps us know when to expect more here too. We get a little worried when the small ones stop for too long, ussually means we are due for a big one.","5"
"218","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Like the title says, if you f- with earthquakes this is the app for you! It gives you all the earthquakes. I like to know what’s going on with quakes. I’ve learned about a lot of new places through this app. Have you ever heard of Bouvet Island? Neither had I. But they just had a 5.1. Definitely download this app!","5"
"219","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I didn’t realize how often big earthquakes happen. This app is the best one so far in regards to speed of alerting and accuracy. It’s really easy to see exactly where the earthquake is happening on their map.","5"
"220","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","With the new update certain map layers that were free for years have been changed to premium, including the topographical layer which I used all the time. I haven't gone through the rest of the features yet to see what else has been ruined but that one thing is a deal breaker for me. I don’t use this app enough to pay for premium so they will not be getting any money from me.","2"
"221","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It gives yo 20 seconds warning before the quake,,I’m from LA , but all my family is still there so in no in Florida to call them right away. I love this app I am disabled and now they want us to pay for it pretty sure USGA is government funded  already paid for with taxes","5"
"222","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app used to show me earthquake  activity within 25 miles from where I live and the data showed up when I opened the app.  Now there is no way to get it.  Apparently I don’t meet the search requirements?  Forget it","5"
"223","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","QuakeFeed app immediately takes me to the newest quake and lists all required details along with a map of the location. I can look back and view recent activity for regions. Very informative!","5"
"224","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Started having a weird obsession with earthquakes a couple years ago, and this app is great for that. I like knowing when it happens and where, plus it also gives possible tsunami information. Tis a good app to have if you like that stuff.","5"
"225","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Living near several faults within southern Nevada definitely helps to have an app that can track earthquake activity around the surrounding areas. Definitely well worth getting if you live near active faults and or earthquake prone zones. Highly recommend it!","5"
"226","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is by far the best app for earthquakes. It also has a hidden bonus. It maps wildfires and keeps you up to date on their status. I have three other apps for wildfires and this one is hands down the best. Thank you fir the hidden gem.","5"
"227","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Since the last update I’m unable to open the app. I received notifications but when I try to open the app for more info it crashes. I’m using an iPhone 8 Thank you for the update on the system and responding so quickly to the fix.","5"
"228","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve been using this for about a year and just upgraded. It works most of the time and gives a good list of where earthquakes are happening. Every now and then it says “network error “, but it usually corrects in an hour or so. The free version is good, too, but it is nice to do away with the ads for $0.99 a year.","4"
"229","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have always found being informed about weather, tsunami’s and earthquakes can help you prepare for what may lie ahead. This app allows me to stay up to date with earthquakes all over the world. It is both accurate and timely.","5"
"230","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Having lived in a small community most of my life this app. supplies me with unique look at the world. I was in Southern California when a 7+ earthquake hit. I have watched floors and wall undulate, up and down, back and forth. I was hooked. I was 13 at the time, but even so I knew there was a trigger for a quake. And I've been looking ever sense.","5"
"231","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Not sure what all was updated for the most recent version (v5?), but the previous version was definitely better. If the map style is changed to bathymetric the app crashes and it can’t be changed unless the app is uninstalled. The map itself doesn’t retain the zoom level or extent view like previous versions either. The map styles also tend to wash out the markers, making them hard to see.","2"
"232","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I really enjoyed quake feed I get notifications of earthquakes that I want I can choose which size earthquake I want to be notified of and which ones I don’t but quick feed does show them all. I love it it’s great thank you quake Feed.","5"
"233","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Thank you, for notifying me when there is a earthquake. Due to the fact that I have family internationally and need to know there are alive!!! Because God is not playing one day we will all have to face what the Bible has said will occur!!! God protect us all !!!🙏🏾🌷","5"
"234","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Like the app very much, the display of the wildfires was a nice addition.   If I had a suggestion it would be to a .5 between the selection levels for the magnitude!   I use 5.0 and get a lot of info, but 6.0 not enough so selecting by above 5.5 would be nice!","5"
"235","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Anyone wanting to keep an eye on the quakes happening around the world needs this app. Reports quakes at 2.0 and above and you can adjust settings to notify you of whatever intensity you want it to. Only had this a few days and loving it.","5"
"236","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Each time there’s a quake the notification come through within a few seconds. Kind of like a warning if it were to be close to you.","5"
"237","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Continuos improvement of app adding features and precision of information has been extremely useful in assessing what’s happening in the earth’s crust, specially when you have family and friends living in seismic areas and even infrequent events in non- seismic areas. Congrats to your team of experts,","5"
"238","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have used this app for years, and never thought anything of it and then I got an alert sound I had never heard before and when I looked at my phone and it said you are within 100 miles of a 7.1 earthquake. This is extremely useful. Great app.","5"
"239","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Before QuakeFeed I would feel something shake or something crackle pop and wonder was that earthquake??? But now I just wait for my phone to go beep and sure enough we had an earthquake. It let me know the magnitude and location. I highly recommend you download it.  It is worth it.   brownpjb","5"
"240","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have family in Southern California.  Quake feed alerts give me time to check in with them before news reports of tremors make it difficult to reach them due to clogged landline and cell phone systems.","5"
"241","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’m amazed at how quickly Quake Feed distributes the information on earthquakes from around the world!  I appreciate being able to see this information so quickly!!","5"
"242","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Do you monitor my access to my phone or iPad ? Just saying every time I pick up my phone your app lights up like a Christmas tree! Other than that it seems to be null. ??? What I’m trying to say it seems like your app is tracking me. If I’m wrong I’m sorry but I can’t help but notice. I love your app!!!","4"
"243","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It is the most useful app ever!  One suggestion:  for any earthquake with a real tsunami, can you change the color to blue bubble?  This will bring it to our attention fast.  Just a thought … more programming changes and testing (sorry).","5"
"244","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have tried many but this by far works better and easier to use than any other app out there, would recommend it to all my family and friends","5"
"245","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have a young friend whose home sits on a small fault. Although I live 2400+ miles away, I worry about her. While I can’t prevent a quake, this app puts my mind at ease. When I get a notification of a quake, I don’t have to worry if it affects her and her husband. I know instantly.","5"
"246","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I find it very interesting how dynamic the earth is and how often it is moving under our feet. Living in California I can feel how often that is. I really appreciate this app showing me not just the local activity but what others are experiencing, too. Thanks!","5"
"247","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is so easy and wonderful to use really like it. For just knowing what's going on around you but also in the rest of the world. Easy to navigate through all the things as well which makes it a fantastic app to use even at a quick glance","5"
"248","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","You get so much information for the small fee that’s charged. Not only does it provide awareness but I’m able to use it to help me in my college courses due to all of the information provided.","5"
"249","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’m always surprised at how many earthquakes happen around the world and I like that I can zoom in on the map and see the location. Adding forrest fire and major storm information is an added plus. Thanks for the great app.","5"
"250","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like this app when it works. But too many times a notification comes up for an earthquake but when I click on the notification, I get just a basic white screen with a couple of selections at the top. Just happened a few minutes ago with an alert for a 6.8 in Morocco.","3"
"251","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Had this app for a while and finally began to make it more specific for my needs. It allows me to be very specific and information is current.","5"
"252","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s nice to get important information before you get it through the news media. They are still thinking about it while I already have the facts.","5"
"253","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Every earthquake I feel, I get to see where the epicenter is as well as how big the quake was. Even though I feel them, it assures me of what I felt. Info seems to take a while to come in, but I’m guessing that is for accuracy.","5"
"254","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Loving this app!  Feature request: it would be nice to be able to filter by alerts. Something that would allow you to see only those events that triggered a notification.","5"
"255","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live close to the Southern coast of California. My elevation is only 7 feet above sea level so I am interested in seeing early reports of potential tsunamis. QuakeFeed provides me with this information which my someday save my life by giving me many hours to avoid traffic leaving the area.","5"
"256","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","After the 1st quake hit followed by all of the aftershocks, I needed to know if I was really feeling them or was it all in my head. This app kept me aware and helped to make sense of everything that was happening seismically. It became more important to me than social media apps with the information.","5"
"257","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve had the app for years and loved it up until the last few months. I have everything set the same way but it no longer gives me local alerts (I’ve gotten plenty of alerts for 6.0+ around the world lately) and the map no longer opens to my area. When I open the app, the list is blank. When I go to the map, it goes to the Ring of Fire but doesn’t show any of the earthquakes I’ve received notifications about. Guess it’s time to find a new app.","1"
"258","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have been looking for a good earthquake app and at first I thought this was it.  Map is good and data is populated pretty quickly.  The bad part is trying to change notifications never works.  I have tried changing it to be specific to my Geo and not worldwide many times and it seems to reset after a couple days back to the defaults.  Really wish the app developers could fix this.","2"
"259","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","As the bugs have been fixed this app has work better and better. There are arguments occasionally about whether we are feeling earthquakes or artillery fire from a local army base. This software has settled a lot of arguments! 😁","5"
"260","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","App can give you some insight to the ever changing world. Looking at tectonic activity over time or watching day to day gives an interesting view of what may be happening below. Also alerts which can be set to notify of nearby activity may keep you aware of potential activity in your area.","4"
"261","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It lets me know where it is. How deep the Quakes are. The magnitude of the Quake. It’s tells you a lot more than I wrote. Let’s you know with certain sound that there was a quake. I didn’t realize how many quakes this big old earth has daily. So I like it,","5"
"262","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Having a major quake RB&RHyesterday it was nice to be able to go to this site and get all the information I needed regarding the earthquake. We haven’t had a major one in years so this information in a timely manner was wonderful to have.","5"
"263","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Deleted from iPhone 6 too many screen hogging ads you can’t make go away.","5"
"264","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love this app , it always tells me when any quake is happening close to the family and it takes about 10 seconds after it happened to me me know … Thank you !","5"
"265","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Living in California is very scary between the fires and the earthquakes it’s quite and experience and very stressful and having this app at least gives us the ability to know what is going on and if it’s near us. Thank you so much!","5"
"266","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Living in Alaska i really appreciate the speed that Quakefeed reports earthquakes, and the ability to access tsunami information directly from the app. Its been super helpful the few times we had major quakes while i was driving and unaware of what had happened.","5"
"267","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like this app although I do not receive a lot of data anymore because the way I have my features set up on the app, overall I would recommend this app to anyone that is concerned 😟 about weather pattern on the earths fault line, 🙏 😉 😊 overall very nice","5"
"268","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great little app. Quickly shows where quake is plus details to it's strength. I like it! I have been using it for years. From California and was always aware of quakes. Now I can get up to date info very quickly.","5"
"269","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Living in So. Cal has weather advantages for sure.  Along with our great weather comes possibly of earthquakes constantly. (with small unfelt quake’s daily). QuakeAlert gives me a “Heads Up” alert to earthquakes around the globe which I appreciate.","5"
"270","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I don’t remember there being this many ads before? Granted it’s been a few months since I’ve checked the app but this is a bit much. I was trying to zoom in on the map to follow a fault line and roughly every 45 s to 2 minutes an ad popped up and reset my progress. I gave up after the 3rd try. Crazy annoying. Gonna look for a new earthquake app.","2"
"271","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is fabulous !!    Easy to use.   Not to mention if you have any problems or questions, it gets resolved quick and they will get back to you in a timely manner.    Thank you again!!!","5"
"272","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have been using this app for at least 5 years and it has been a fantastic tool. Many settings for configurations for specific needs.","5"
"273","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is an important app for me because my son and family live in an earthquake zone that is quite active. This allows me to check in with him within minutes of a quake.","5"
"274","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app has been a favorite for mane years.  I I’ve used it to keep track of Southern California.  I have family who lives there.   The app is now unable to display there is a “network error” when updating earthquake.  I deleted and downloaded the app again.  It still has the same error and now the regional alert is stuck.  The souther California is stuck at 8+ and worldwide at 6+.  It is therefore useless to me now. I am deleting it.","1"
"275","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","We live in earthquake country so it’s always good to know what is coming. I like the way you can set the app at whichever level of earthquake magnitude you want and it will tell you what’s going on around you. It’s very accurate!","5"
"276","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Living with the memory of the biggest EQ in the USA, and having an average of 35 tremors a day this is a useful app! I live on the fault line near Anchorage and I study the patterns of EQ near my area. This app reminds me to prepare my business. You can't enjoy the best in Alaska without being prepared for the worst!","5"
"277","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","One of the most useful apps I possess. A bedrock of staying informed during critical times. Helps to focus help for friends and family in specific areas. Informs us on suitable travel routes and hazards related to earthquakes and fires. Vital tool for those of us in Northern California.","5"
"278","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Most earthquake apps have been just functional for me. This one has a very well-designed interface that looks good too. It always is quick on reporting quakes as well.","5"
"279","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Since the last update 5.2.1. Mine has failed to list the earthquakes listed in my settings, and can’t find anywhere to go to fix the problem. It alerts me but does not stay in the list.","4"
"280","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","There are several good earthquake maps but I like the simplicity of this one.  And I had two question about how to make things work and the app developers got back to me in a matter of hours. Have you ever heard of that happening?","5"
"281","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","QuakeFeed is accurate, fast and detailed. I use it for daily updates for my work as an international emergency response staff and also for monitoring earthquakes where I live in Southern California. I highly recommend this application as part of your disaster preparedness planning.","5"
"282","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Have used this app for several years.  No need to wait for a news report, this app alerts you as soon as an earthquake occurs.  I have my settings to alert me for quakes over 6.0.  They occur almost every week someplace on earth.  Very strange...that’s another topic all together!","5"
"283","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Tried to delete notifications settings and the app kept putting the same notifications back in. So I changed it instead. That appeared to work because the setting is different. But I am still getting notifications from around the world when my settings say United States only.","3"
"284","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I enjoyed this app but a recent update has made it useless. Suddenly I am unable to get any information!  Also I have been frustrated because I can’t get the app to tell me about quakes around me. I usually know when there are quakes on the other side of the world but no idea about those in my area.  As I try to submit this review and put in a nickname, it should tell you something when the nicknames “disappointed” & “frustrated” (among many others) are taken.","1"
"285","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Recently was traveling/staying in southern Oregon. The new wildfires info was key in us being able to track our proximity to the large fire and ensuring we were not in any danger. Thanks QuakeFeed!","5"
"286","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love the world map features with multiple reporting systems, and the new premium features I am soon to add. $5 a year is super reasonable for what this app has to offer. You can’t hate on an app that does exactly what it says and more.","5"
"287","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a great app and shows you just how active our planet is. Also allows me to know if my family in Mexico have experienced any quakes as soon as they happen.","5"
"288","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I set my alerts & it notifies me of certain areas.  When is tap on the notifications it used to take me directly to that quake info & on the map.  It no longer does this.  This is the reason I set these alerts.  GRR","5"
"289","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Loaded this app about a month ago.  Have been looking at it several times a day.   It gives me all the information I need to stay current. I'm surprised just how many quakes there are. Very educational and very quick!","5"
"290","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app always alerts me to an earthquake. It’s easy to filter and set parameters. I have mine set for 4.0 and above. I highly recommend this app if you want to always be alerted to quakes in your area of interest.","5"
"291","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live near the Wabash and New Madrid faults. I like to keep aware of the activity for the fault lines near me.  Watching the movement of other local, national and international faults and subduction zones is an educational and fun activity for my family. I recommend this app to everyone.","5"
"292","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I got this just to keep me posted on the big earthquakes around the world; however, it took on a new importance when a big one (for my area) hit in 2020. It was nice to get the confirmation of quake vs. truck driving by.","5"
"293","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","As both an offshore sailor and resident of Southern California, this site provides substantial information on the location, severity and possible tsunami effects of earthquakes. It’s timely and updates frequently. If you’re a traveler, this information may save your life","5"
"294","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app provides very good information and easy to setup to get the earthquake information/notices you want or need. I like that there is a map feature so I can see exactly where the quakes are in relation to my family and friends.","5"
"295","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I enjoyed this app for years but now my alerts have quit working and can’t be reset. Something is broken and needs attention. I have upgraded to premium and now after many attempts to reset the preferences and after reloading the app it is working again.","4"
"296","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This App is spot-on for notifying me about real time earthquakes. Very little wait time for current activity around the world. I can depend on getting accurate quake info. Settings are used with ease. Great job developers!","5"
"297","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have been using this Earthquake app for a couple years and It has been great for notifications on earthquakes in real time with information on locations, depth and tsunami alerts. Very helpful and informative app.","5"
"298","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I appreciate having the information on where, how often, how depth and strong, how far away from me are these earthquakes.  I live on the west coast of the US and such information could be a timely warning and life saver.  San Andreas- Cascadia Neighbor","5"
"299","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Really love tracking earthquakes activities by region. After trying other apps, no doubt I will stay with QuakeFeed. Real time alerts makes a world of a difference, specially when Tsunamis may be involved. Keep the good work!","5"
"300","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Have been using it for a while. Very informative and accurate.  Helps me monitor areas around the world where friends and family reside. Most friends are based in military bases and it’s great to know their status if a quake hits.","5"
"301","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","What is the total effect on the earth with so many earthquakes? Is it similar to breaking up concrete?  Keep cutting the line /fault and it finally breaks? Each quake is small in proportion to the earth but is each quake accumulated?","5"
"302","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I really like this app. Since I have friends all around the world, I like knowing where the earth is quaking. At times, it is shocking to know how many tremors and earthquakes happen everyday, but I would rather know, than not.","5"
"303","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I'm always amazed by the activity of the earth.  Wish the latest upgrade didn’t change the font size.  Now the text is so large I can only see a few readings on the page at a time.","5"
"304","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have used this app for several years now, and have always given it 5 stars, because it does what it’s supposed too. When I updated it, who knew it could be even better! Nice work!","5"
"305","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I was born and raised in Alaska, and living on the coast West Coast my entire life, where   Earthquakes are as regular as rain is in Seattle!! No other app comes close to what QuakeFeed dose!! The customization features are incredible!! This is an Amazing app!! A true Home-Run! Wish I could give it more stars!!","5"
"306","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The App keeps me informed as a move about during my daily activities. I can setup my alerts and know I will get the activity alerts as they occurs. I am very satisfied with the performance of the App.","5"
"307","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Whenever I feel a sensation or hear of a trembling on the news, I know the information on this site app is reliable and accurate.","5"
"308","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve always been interested in earthquakes and this app is awesome. It gives as much or as little info as you choose. Being able to follow earthquakes on a global scale has raised my appreciation of geology and  the world in general.","5"
"309","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have enjoyed this app for many years. It provides data for locations of interest within a short period of time after the events. Thanks to the team.","5"
"310","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This site asked me Do you enjoy QuakeFeed?. I believe they were going for appreciate or value.  After all who actually enjoys an earthquake?  But I answered yes because I do appreciate and value the information the app provides.","5"
"311","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Many months ago your App now has changed city names from standard English to their foreign character spelling😡.  Such as Japan, now you can’t read any city unless you understand Japanese characters! All map layouts should be in English, which most of the world tends to understand as a common world communicative language. Please update this, otherwise it’s useless as a worldwide informational tool.","2"
"312","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app allows me to view up to the minute QuakeFeed around the world. If it’s a local quake I often have the accurate information before the news does.","5"
"313","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like to look around the world to see where earthquakes are happening and especially where I live and my family.  It’s just very interesting to to watch what’s happening around the world.","5"
"314","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love the app but it needs to be on top too slow with the warnings something. I just got one that happened last night it should not have a delay. These are within 50 miles of us. Please fix this thanks","5"
"315","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I did prefer the style of putting the information on the quakes in a “bubble” format, allowing you to still see the map, rather then having to slide up the information, blocking the map entirely!","5"
"316","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I hate having a notification for an earth quake, at night. I see the notifications on the app itself. I open the app, can’t see that earth quake. That one should be highlighted as soon as I open front and center. I don’t want to scroll threw hundreds of earth quacks trying to guess which one alerted me.   The app is pretty cool, but definitely didn’t have much thought out into the user","2"
"317","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","One totally 5 star app. Lots of fun to use. Still a lot of fun to use. 5/2/23 - Outstanding upgrades. Globe view and other maps are fun to use and educational. One map setting caught my attention-USA Earthquake Risk. Expanded map settings are great.","5"
"318","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a very excellent app – I’ll check it all the time – especially to keep tabs on what’s going on at Yellowstone and out in the Pacific. Developers you’re doing a beautiful job thank you","5"
"319","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","QuakeFeed Earth provides us with notifications of earthquakes across the world and other related information, which we use to provide assistance and communications in hard hit areas.","5"
"320","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I don’t know if these people want me to care about a 4.3 quake on the other side of the planet, but they make it difficult or impossible to turn it off. The result of this is that the app has trained me to consider the audible alert as an annoyance rather than an actual warning. Probably good for their ad revenue though.","2"
"321","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Enjoy checking out all kinds of activity on this app. It takes you right to the location and gives you all kinds of intriguing info. 👍🏽","5"
"322","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I subscribed to the map for the new wildfire information. As an avid off road cyclist having a quick and handy access to wildfire data will prove very useful in staying safe while outdoors.","5"
"323","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Also lets you set the Range Limit to, for Eg., 4.0 & Above ONLY. Also lets you select a Distance Limit, based on your Interest Range. Notifications can be turned ON or OFF. Maps shows you the Location. Depth & Richter Scale are always on Top.","5"
"324","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","With so many family and friends in California, I worry about quakes. This has been a great app to use so I am aware. Nice features that let you select specific filters and notifications are rapid!","5"
"325","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","We are always on top of earthquakes around the world!  Fast and informative of world wide earthquake information.  This is both very informative and fascinating to follow. We really like the ability to change the settings and the topographical images.","5"
"326","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have been using this app for several years and I really like it. It allows you to select which level of quakes it displays and if you receive notifications. I like being able to check where quakes happened each day. I recommend this app.","4"
"327","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love this app! Living in CA earthquake territory can leave you feeling uneasy but this app lets you know if it’s real or a figment of your imagination! Also worth mentioning the real-time notifications of magnitude and location are great","5"
"328","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like this app to be aware of the worlds activities on the smallest to the largest current quakes.  You can adjust how strong of earthquakes for alerts you are interested in.","5"
"329","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Always has the latest earthquake information. Tells me exactly where the earthquake was and where it was felt and how strong.","5"
"330","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","My son and I really enjoy this app. Especially living on the west coast in California, we watch for tsunami activity. We also like to monitor other places that have had a significant earthquake. Thank you for this app and the educational aspect of it.","5"
"331","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app does exactly what you expect it to do. It notifies you of earthquakes in whatever geographical region you select. It works very very well and is very informative. I rated it five stars because I couldn’t expect it to do more than it does. Great job to the developers.","4"
"332","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app was very useful during our recent shaking this past month. There has been so much movement everywhere and I like being informed as to where and when and the alerts it provides as well.","4"
"333","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","For several years I have used Quake Feed, monitoring all sort of seismic activity. Quake Feed is always on time and accurate. I have only praise for the people who developed and produced the software. Way to go!","5"
"334","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a fantastic and helpful app. I have instant access to earthquakes and fault lines around the world. If ever there is an earthquake nearby - I instantly have details about exact location, magnitude and depth.","5"
"335","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Reliable app.  There is a short delay.  My son lives in California and texted me about 2 mins before my app went off.  But I would imagine it takes time to get the data in.  This is a good app, though many I know use it.","5"
"336","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I had no idea how many quakes were happening in my area until I found this app! Sometimes I don’t feel them but the app confirmed the one I felt the other day.","5"
"337","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This Is one of the Sign of “the Last Days,” or “End Times”? Great earthquakes. Jesus said that there would be “earthquakes in one place after another.” (Matthew 24:7; Luke 21:11) These great earthquakes around the world would cause suffering and loss of life on an unprecedented scale.","5"
"338","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love this app because when my kids where in Alaska I could keep up with the earthquakes.  They where in Fairbanks so their were earthquakes all around but none hit them directly.","5"
"339","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Have used for awhile & was generally pleased until, suddenly, the map feature stopped working; just a blank gray canvas. Waited some time (~3+ months) hoping it would self-correct then submitted a problem ticket & waited for promised reply. And waited, and waited. A couple weeks later I resubmitted trouble ticket. (At least the submittal system acknowledged it was my 2nd message.) A week later no map & still waiting.","1"
"340","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live east of Tokyo and frequently use QuakeFeed. Within minutes of tonght’s 7.3 magnitude earthquake, QuakeFeed provided the exact distance of the quake from my home. I now have to clean up the mess from the quake.","5"
"341","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Keeps up with all of the pertinent seismic activity around the world before any other information source. They are always accurate and up to date.","5"
"342","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app provides me with the fast updated in need for my possible sunamis. I leave close to the coast in jamaica and we don’t a warning system. Any earthquake close to jamaica close to sea I am taking evasive action","5"
"343","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It works great while telling everything I need to know about a particular quake. I like that I can set the level of quake that I want to be notified about. This is my earthquake app of choice!","5"
"344","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The notifications are very quick and it tells you all the necessary stats for each earthquake. It also tells you how far it is away from your own destination and any tsunami warnings.","5"
"345","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It can take a while for news organizations to get out information about quakes. This app give info right away and pinpoints the location. Since I live where both quakes and tsunamis are a potential threat, it's great to have it.","5"
"346","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I wish I knew how to read what the different tech tonic colors were. I have been all through the application and cannot find an explanation of the colors for the fault lines. Otherwise it is a very worthwhile application. I have recommended it to many people, especially with my friends in DMAT","4"
"347","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","What’s happened to this app? Lately I haven’t been getting notifications. Even the big ones lately. I tried to go into settings and change my notification but the system tells me there’s an error and won’t save my change. I’ll be looking for a different app.","3"
"348","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","On the quake list, I noticed that some of the new or recent information sorta disappeared. I do like the map and the features though. I live in Southern California and we’ve had a few earthquakes recently. This app has definitely helped. Thanks!","4"
"349","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have used the QuakeFeed app for many years.  I lived in Chile for a few years and found it so useful.  One can view the plate tectonics and locations.  The wild fires addition is an added bonus.  Keep up the good work!","5"

"352","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Absolutely most reliable notification with exact location I’m truly impressed and glad I gave this app. Nothing like being alert at all times.","5"
"353","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love the site but I don’t like the new changes you implemented. I find it more difficult to find the current quake location due to the color changes. In this respect, I like the old format better.","5"
"354","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Yep, you’re right!  Should have spent a little more time with it.  With a little help from Support I was able to change the time period for recent earthquakes shown on map.  App is now and should have been rated 5/5.  Thanks Support Team!","5"
"355","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","You keep giving the coordinates for earthquakes right under where I live, when the quake is in another location. If it hadn’t been for the Magna, Utah earthquake I probably wouldn’t have gone on believing there was fault right under my house. Magna is 15 miles from my house.  I coded the app to give me earthquakes 2.0 or bigger in Utah, and worldwide 5.0 and greater, but you give me earthquakes all over the world 2.0 or greater. Plus I wanted a separate sound for that, which I rarely get.","1"
"356","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app gives you all of the information you need and then some. It would be nice if you could bring the maps in closer to see the area better. I use it all the time. I live in UPSTATE N.Y. I don't have any quakes in my area yet until they start FRACKING In N.Y.","5"
"357","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Updated reports and great information. Keeps me aware of areas which need help! The activity places near me and mine- even when we can’t really feel them.","5"
"358","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I am a information freak. I need to know the world escenario. I monitor earthquakes throughout the world, because it was the only hard evidence Christ said of future events. So being well informed can help me know the situation of world scenarios. This app is very precise and instantly I know what is going on. I appreciate your Company in designing a superb instrument.","3"
"359","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Living in LA you def want to be in sync with geo activity, I tried all related apps and this one works best. Last week we had a 4.4 shake and it was reported instantly while I was taking cover under the table))","5"
"360","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s a go-to for up to date information about seismic activity and now fires - it keeps getting better, but desperately need a search capability on the map. Hard to find places especially if they are tiny in the middle of vast ocean.","3"
"361","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is better than I expected and fascinating to work with, especially when one receives the unexpected notifications. It truly makes one realize the fragility of our planet","5"
"362","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Living in Hawaii has made me a great fan of QuakeFeed. I can check the location and the magnitude of an earthquake within minutes. It also allows me to participate in citizen science by reporting what I felt. It is an excellent tool for teaching kids about earthquakes and rift zones too.","5"
"363","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Working very well since last update fixed crashing issue from previous update. I really do like this app and find it easy to use","5"
"364","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like the droplets with the intensity number zoom in and more detail.  You are given exact location date and time , intensity, also previous quakes around the world.","5"
"365","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This ap loads fast and provides real time quake information for the globe. Map views are great for seeing fault lines and getting perspective on population impact. Highly recommend this app","5"
"366","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Really enjoying having this app. I have had it for a couple of years now and it is very easy to use and as a geologist hi like the ability to see what earthquakes are happening around the world including near me which is an earthquake prone area.","5"
"367","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Being a newshound i need to know the latest, when it happens, not when news wires report it. This app is in-depth, up-to-the-minute reporting. The info is so interesting that it is the first app i go to every morning","5"
"368","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Because the last earthquake 7.0 It was big and felt allerts on phone dogs acting weird . I got home from work it keeps me alert while at work . But will be better big screen","5"
"369","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It is somewhat comforting to know I will receive info regarding my area if an earthquake happens near me. Good going folks. I like the info window that pops up when I tap on a notification. Good job on the app and it’s workability.","5"
"370","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Provides timely information on earthquakes. However does not provide corresponding information on any tsunami or data at the local level. Also, does not archive the information so that the user has access to such information.","4"
"371","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Normally I’d give this 5 stars. But a large earthquake just happened locally and  I can’t get any information on it because I’ve been getting a Network Error for the past 30 min. Kind of defeats the purpose of it, doesn’t it? 🙄","4"
"372","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Like the app. Easy to use and see. Would like more info -- depth of movement, type of movement if known (strike/slip, over/under, etc.), surface manifestations if any, but at least the app gives you a good starting place to get more info from other sources.","4"
"373","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I use this app all the time.  Love the different options for different regions.  I can find info on earthquakes any where in the world. Now that it’s fire  season I can also find info on wild fires.","5"
"374","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Just interested in earth quake whereabouts. I do wish when I touch a notification it would open to that location on the map.","5"
"375","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great app to have so you can check on those local tremors right after they happen and it is super accurate. Also, see the activity from around the world.","5"
"376","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is awesome! It alerted me about the new eland earthquakes last week, (Cause I heard about a Hawaii Tsunami) and because I love earthquakes! Recently in my city there was a small earthquake and moments after the shaking started I got a notification! I was wowed at how they did that! Thanks quakefeed!","5"
"377","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The latest update to this app has an issue. The app is not working . You click on it and it goes back to the main phone screen. I won’t open. Otherwise this is a very good app.","5"
"378","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Lately i am receiving the notifications late, almost an hour later, everything works perfect, i use this app for many years, very accurate and useful and just need to kill few bugs in there","4"
"379","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live in California and this is the best app to figure out where the earthquakes are coming from. My wife stays down by the Mexican border working. And this is where earthquakes happen almost on a  reoccurring basis.  Till California drops into the ocean, I will use this app.","5"
"380","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","While my settings for notifications is for 400 from my location I keep receiving global alerts. Frustrating but confident they will fix this.","5"
"381","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I'm a school teacher and I use this app all the time to help keep track of all the activity on the earth with my class.  It makes learning come alive!  It’s so accurate and I love the notifications because my daughter is so close to CA.","5"

"383","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I get alerted when there is an earthquake and I can see on a map where it happened and weather a tsunami alert was posted. It’s very interesting and I like being informed.","5"
"384","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Not only seeing the larger ones but being able to view the closer ones is quite interesting.","5"
"385","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I miss the different types of faults. And, not thrilled with the new default screen that added the earthquake listing. But, still an excellent app. Fast and accurate. I’m still a fan.","5"
"386","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Have been using this app for several years. Recently, they introduced wildfires for the U.S., and I directly upgraded to premium to have that feature too. Great app, never bugs!","5"
"387","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live in Palm Springs, California, within sight of the San Andreas fault line. It is always comforting to receive a clear breakdown of any tremor within a few seconds of feeling it. A must have app for anyone living in “the zone”.","5"
"388","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Resourceful information to the minute. But I wish you could zoom into the map better to see all surrounding cities near the quakes. Or be able to measure the distant between ones location and the epicenter.","4"
"389","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","You guys messed this up, thinking of removing this app.  It was great before, i would have donated to keep it the same. Now there are zero controls other than basic sorting that doesn't allow for much. Forcing people to pay for an upgrade to get what they had for free is going to backfire on you.  Sad and a poor professional choice.  Leave the free version as is, build a more professional version for a fee.","1"
"390","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I don’t mind ads to support a free app. However I don’t appreciate ads that are not suitable for all ages. I don’t know what the ad was for but it involved implied sex and cheating.  How the app works for its intended purpose remains to be seen. I downloaded it to see if there had been recent earthquake activity where I live. I was able to search and sort.","3"
"391","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I tried installing this app twice and both times when it asked for permission to always track my location or to track my location only when I’m using the app I chose the latter. It never progressed towards installing on my phone beyond that point. I will not give this app permission to always track my position and would therefore give it zero stars but then I couldn’t leave a comment here I think.","1"
"392","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve use this app for years it use to be good  and then the last year it’s gotten too hard to figure out and glitchy for California, I would get a notice saying there was an earthquake and go to the notice and there’s nothing there, canceled my subscription.","3"
"393","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love being kept up to date with the world around me... Thank you! Still a fan! .. after all these years ! It's interesting to keep up with and watch the seismic activity everywhere ! Thank you!","5"
"394","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great graphics and up to date info user friendly  California resident and have been through some big earthquakes learned to keep abreast of any shaking that can cause damage. This app does just that","5"
"395","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Updates come within minutes of events. App  provides accurate data, and filters allow for multiple views of events.","5"
"396","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Enjoying this app gives alerts all over the world. Great to know for family and friends living in those areas.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","5"
"397","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve taken time to customize the settings to what i want and like. It NEVER remembers them and i constantly get notifications about earthquakes on the other side of the planet. So i shut notifications off, which defeats the purpose of having an earthquake warning app.  How hard can it be to fix these bugs?","3"
"398","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app has always been stable and very dependable; however current major activity appears to have been a bit much for this app.  Hoping the clocking issue after sizable aftershocks gets resolved soon.","4"
"399","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like it because it gives the best information on where they are going to be","5"
"400","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live on the coast near sea level- the app reports big quakes and includes links to reports of tsunami potential in my area. This part is very useful.","5"
"401","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","OK I am a nerd. I love this  app. It does provide info on earthquakes as they happen. A good example was the earthquakes in Turkey. So sad that happened. When I checked online, no one was really reporting it when it appeared on QuakeFeed.","5"
"402","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live in an area with frequent earthquakes. Not only is this data and the way it is presented with alerts and in the app concise and informative, it’s fascinating to see as well!","5"
"403","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The data provided is fantastic, their customer support will answer any question you ask and help you resolve your issues as best they can.","5"
"404","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Can be a little slow to update from time to time, but most of the features you would care about are free to use. Range to monitor is also highly customizable.","4"
"405","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I never realize there were so many 7.0 earthquake‘s happening around the world. It’s been enlightening to see that we don’t get news reporting on them.","5"
"406","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live in the Ring of Fire. I do like to know what’s up and where.  Everyone up here (Alaska) is “waiting for the big one” to hit again. The red alerts don’t work. Otherwise I’m happy. 🙏🏻thanks","5"
"407","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s a good app to have with the exception that it gives you alerts for anything over a certain number anywhere in the world and I only have it to monitor where my family lives. I don’t appreciate the mini heart attacks because of an earthquake half way across the world. I wanna know if there’s an emergency with my family.","2"
"408","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Wow. I get notified nearly immediately when a quake happens. Actually when I get my wits back, the notice is already on my phone. Very interesting to see where and the frequency of earthquakes.","4"
"409","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Often when I hear creaking or what seems like footsteps I turn to the app and find that there has been a small earthquake near my house, since we are on a fault, and it helps me not be nervous about intruders!","5"
"410","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Since I have lived in Southern California I depend on knowing about earthquakes and get accurate information and the one and only source l have found to be accurate and dependable I depend on QuakeFeed for me and my family thank you","5"
"411","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I am 2500 miles away from my daughter in Bakersfield this app helps me stress less knowing I can get notifications if quakes are of higher magnitude and allows me to teach my daughter to keep her quake kits in her home and in her car.","5"
"412","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Today I’ve experienced over 50 easy to feel aftershocks to the 6.4 Searles Valley Quake. This app has been so helpful in tracking the quakes. It’s been a stressful day and this has helped in reducing some of that. I’ll continue to use this!","5"
"413","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app works great if you don’t want to customize the alerts for specific areas. Just don’t enable alerts otherwise you’re going to get global alerts.","5"
"414","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’m using this app few years already and it’s really good they give you your information about time and when happens and real time I love it","5"
"415","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I travel a lot and being able to know if something significant has occurred where my family is anytime any day is a great tool.","5"
"416","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Besides getting notified of bigger quakes their page makes it easy find current larger quakes. Some ofthe larger quakes going on around the are not mentioned at all like right now quakes at a volcano in Italy","4"
"417","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This APP is extremely fun to watch and reference.  It is quite an eye opener to see just how many quakes of all magnitude’s occur daily . Even the weaker ones that are local can be seen and located.  It’s great!","5"
"418","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Finger tip information and know what is going on around the world without watching news on tv almost hours later.","5"
"419","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Being close to some good earthquakes it is nice to get quick, up to date “refreshes” of what is going on around. Sure the wildfire update would be nice but “not in the budget” for now.","5"
"420","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Hi!  I have my minimum magnitude set to 1.0 and distance from the quake set to 100 miles. Why am I getting alerts about major earthquakes that are or have occurred on the opposite side of the planet. I just received an alert about a quake in the Philippines when I live in the USA. The Philippines is more than 100 miles away.","3"
"421","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I check it quite a bit.  I like the ability to change the magnitude of quakes.  Its well thought out and I will continue to watch the signs of the time unfold.","5"
"422","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Notifications make all the difference!","5"
"423","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The best app to have if you live in California or anywhere on the pacific rim or if you have family in those areas. QuakeFeed keeps us abreast within minutes of a quack. An essential tool!","5"
"424","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This gives real time earthquake information and allow you to set alerts based on the Richter scale. Great app. Gives me information long before live news feeds even starts to report","5"
"425","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I cannot use this app on my iPad anymore with this 5.0.3 update. It works great on my iPhone with the exact same settings, however, it’s not showing any earthquakes at all on the iPad. I have sent in two messages through the help and my iPad QuakeFeed icon has a red number 2 on it, but I can’t find any messages or figure out what the 2 means. I’m very disappointed at this point.","1"
"426","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I enjoy this app but miss the ability to view the location on an actual map like Google Earth. This doesn’t give the detail of the surrounding area as well. Otherwise I really enjoy it.","5"
"427","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great app to keep track of where earthquakes happen and so you know when the bed starts shaking your not having a stroke. 😁 It’s scary how many earthquakes happen everyday in many cases every hour or less.","5"
"428","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I've Checked out other Quake sites and this one is #1!   2 years ago in my home town of Napa, California at 3am we had a 6.+ Quake. Our Town had a Lot of Damage. My house included.  Since then I check out surrounding(100 mile area) Quake activity.    If the Air moves my Hair...EARTH😳QUAKE!!! 99.9 percent of the time it is the Air😏. But it's Wonderful to be able to check it out.   I've Checked out a bunch of EQ sites and this one by far is the Best I've seen.   Keep up the Great Work Earth Quake Site!    Thanks from Julie HM. of Napa Valley🙋🏻","5"
"429","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s great to get notifications about earthquakes, to see how many there actually are. It shows the earths plates and where exactly the quakes are. When one is close, the notifications sound changes. Great app!!!","5"
"430","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Have been using this app for a long time and find the information provided to be great. But have to say that the recent version as of of January 2021 is terrible in how the information is presented. The previous version of the app was clean and easy to read, the new version is cluttered and visually irritating.","3"
"431","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I immediately messaged my friend, who called me to say he was alright. We talked for about 5 minutes before the news even broadcasted it! This really is quite the game changer! I love this ap!","5"
"432","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I absolutely love this App and feel compelled to tell everyone within hearing about each and every new earthquake. It’s fascinating to see just how many happen every day and where they are clustered.","5"
"433","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","You feel the quake and the app tells you how big it was - in a matter of moments. You think you felt a quake and check the app to see if it wasn't something else in the neighborhood. Glad to have it!","4"
"434","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a really good app. It shows all the quake s and where they all are at and if there is one close to me. You get perineum for 1.99$ and it’s worth it. It tracks hurricanes, volcanos, fires, and more! Download this app now people!","5"
"435","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","QuakeFeed provides a user friendly way of getting up-to-the-minute reliable earthquake information based on the criteria I have designated in this app.","5"
"436","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","For up to the minute earthquake information look no further , a necessity .","5"
"437","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","No more European feed only usgs is a major bummer! I felt like I got way more info from the other feed. Still the only app I’ve found that shows how many earthquakes in a given timeframe and I like that. Please bring back esmc feed!","3"
"438","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a great nap because you can track earthquakes you can track wildfires hurricanes and tornadoes so make sure you know what’s going on around you or below your feet","5"
"439","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I receive the data without any problem, however it doesn’t do me much good if I can’t either sort it or be able to pull out one location to see a trend. Certainly would not upgrade without features like these.","3"
"440","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app will report on the big one when it comes and it will come one day. Knowing the details as presented by this app will be most beneficial.","5"
"441","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Easy to use app that keeps you informed of the earthquakes!! I downloaded this almost two years ago and still use this app daily!!","5"
"442","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Your last revisions have a bleached out contrast and the fonts are too small. You tried to fix something that wasn’t broken. Other than that, it is still a great app.","5"
"443","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","We recently had a nearby quake that rattled our house 72 miles away. We found this app and was able to look at the fore- shocks the bigger one and all the after-shocks!","5"
"444","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Took me a bit  to figure out how to configure my alerts. I never realized there were so many earthquakes around the world! Once I finally figured out how to be selective with my alerts I find this very very interesting.","5"
"445","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The color combinations black with Dark blue is terrible. I would’ve given it five stars if you could actually read some of the menu labels at the bottom of the screen.  My eyesight is limited to one eye, and about 65 to 70% vision out of that eye. I need good contrast to be able to see clearly.","4"
"446","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I would love more customizing options - for example chose a region of the world and then be able to sort by date/size etc. as it is right now it’s one or the other and I’m getting a lot of reports that I don’t need/want.","4"
"447","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","User-friendly, and the settings allow filtering to meet my requirements for both global awareness and regional alerts important to folks in the Pacific Northwest.","5"
"448","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have this app since we had a big earthquake here in our area, it’s been a really good source of information every time he have a new earthquake.","5"
"449","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is good information just after you feel a quake. Wish there was an app with a warning.","4"
"450","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s supper accurate and it has the exact location even though it takes a couple minutes to show it it is still great!!","5"
"451","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve been through a few big earthquakes and enjoy checking the latest information on them on this app","5"
"452","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Being using this app actively lately since the latest “episodes” close to home in Isabela, PR and it’s very helpful and accurate when a “quake” hits.  Thanks.","5"
"453","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live in California. This app hits very close to home (once a month at least) it’s nice to know that we really did feel the earth quakes we thought we felt! And to know when to be on alert is very helpful!","5"
"454","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It is nice to see where the earth quakes are and how strong they are.  It usually lets you know within about 5 minutes of the event.","5"
"455","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have used this app for years and it always tells me what is happening in real time. I trust it completely.","5"
"456","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great for getting up to the minute information on earthquakes, anywhere in the world! Much better than relying on internet news feeds.","5"
"457","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Enjoying detailed information on this quake app, which is quite intuitive and logical to maneuver within. Good visual layout.","5"
"458","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The print on the map it’s too light and too small which is not usually a problem for pages because you can expand and cause it to enlarge, except this map enlarges but the words do not which makes no sense.","3"
"459","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Seems like a good app. I get notifications often and the UI seems easy enough. I can't think of anything bad about this app.","5"
"460","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Although we don’t have really any threat from earthquakes here in California, it’s good to know what countries are experiencing devastating earthquake so we can keep them in our prayers as they dig out and rebuild!   Good job!","5"
"461","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Seems that your last update did not include maps.","5"
"462","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","So grateful for this app. Without it I would have no clue when earthquakes happened. There are more earthquakes everyday than I had previously thought.","5"
"463","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Today’s newest, May 25, version locked up on screen titled “Alerts Where You Are”.  iOS 12.3.1 Does not respond to anything.   Will uninstall and try again. ——————- Update:  it’s working now.","5"
"464","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","December 2020 There seems to be a bug introduced with the latest update. The fault lines on the interior of the North American continent have disappeared. For example, the New Madrid fault complex is missing. Gave back a star, ads are less intrusive. We must hunt for the “Close” button bc it is well hidden and a full page ad pops up every time we try to change Settings, etc.  April 2017 Review Knocked off two stars for the intrusive ads.  2015 Review Nice! Developers, please keep up the good work! …please don't screw it up with your April 2016 update.","4"
"465","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a great application, well-suited to both professional and novice earth scientists. It shows earthquake occurrences relative to plate boundaries and keep you up-to-date with the latest earthquakes with notifications. Great satellite imagery as a backdrop. Well done.","5"
"466","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have always loved tracking the geography and geology of our planet. All it takes is one good volcano or earthquake to show us how little we change the earth!","5"
"467","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Helps to keep us up to date on what’s going on with all the earthquakes plus how strong in some areas affected","5"
"468","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have had this app now for many months now and find it EXTREMELY informative and interesting. It really gives a feeling of how we are all interconnected in this World 🌎 of ours.","5"
"469","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love this app...I always get information on quakes before the news sends it out. Not so in love with the updates but overall the app is very useful and immediate.","5"
"470","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","So happy my friend told me about QuakeFeed.  The earthquake data is shown within minutes of the event.  I always reach for my phone when I feel a quake!","5"
"471","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","When there’s a quake in Cali I’m informed immediately, then I can hop on to find out details like magnitude, location, etc. really appreciate this resource for emergency planning and reassurance.","5"
"472","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app works as it should, giving great data with the ability to customize to meet personalized requirements and locations","5"
"473","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It is truly amazing the technology of today. We are able to find out what is happening in just seconds that took days and newspapers to accomplish.","5"
"474","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I am living on an island that had a 7.7 M earthquake two days ago. We have had some large aftershocks. Quake Feed is notifying me of aftershocks and earthquakes in our area after the fact. He much after the fact? 4 hours later. We should be getting alerts due to our location right away. Not 4 hours later.","2"
"475","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I got this app after hearing good things about it. It’s cool to be able to see quakes and how strong they are and how deep; however, with IOS there is a huge bug that requires the app to stay open in the background or you get hundreds of false quake notifications per day. At times I would get 15 false notifications for the same location within minutes of each other.","1"
"476","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","That the shaking you felt was not an side effect of bad wine.  Always quick with updates and information.","5"
"477","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Traveling in earthquake prone areas, having this app is a must. More then once it alerted my team to the possibility of a tsunami after an earthquake and provided us with ample time to take necessary precautions.","5"
"478","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have family in some of the earthquake areas or Ring of Fire. I like being able to monitor these areas.","5"
"479","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a great program for following earthquakes. It has quite a bit of seizemic information. Filters for distances and strength. I live along the Pacific Rim and find it very useful.","5"
"480","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love this app. Especially because when you tap on the notice it takes you to the location in a map and you can research other things.","4"
"481","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great straight forward app and good features such as sorting based on my location. Way better than “My Shake Map”. Glad I switched.","5"
"482","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is both educational and informational. I live in California which is a very active state where Earthquakes are concerned. I have found this to be a very useful app when discovering what exactly is going on.","5"
"483","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Track world wide seismic activity. Maps showing all fault lines, their names, and info available about each quake and possible damage to people and property. Worthwhile, recommended.","4"
"484","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app does exactly what I want: it informs me of large earthquakes so I can keep tabs in the news and follow up later. I need my earthquake and tsunami fix. This is where my fix starts.","5"
"485","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Felt the earthquake 1st time 6.6 and then the 2nd time 6.9.  Both times my app DID NOT LET MET KNOW...both times the app crashed.  Never got the information until 4 hours later and this is our USGS???  Crazy.  App doesn't do what it says it's supposed to do","4"
"486","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app performs well, and in a timely fashion, however there is one annoying bug: the regional alert does not actually track by region, but appears to simply do a word match with the USGS.  This leads to me, a customer in the state of Virginia receiving alerts for Virginia City, Montana.","4"
"487","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app had crash issues recently, but the latest fix cleared that up.  it’s back to being a great source for the latest in global seismic activity.","5"
"488","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Works wonders, highly recommended for earthquake fast notifications anywhere with maps and additional information. Thanks!","5"
"489","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Using for years now. Always accurate and up to date.","5"
"490","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Super fast with epicenters and how big it is. Even if it gets updated later, notifications of that too. Definitely worth it","5"
"491","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a wonderful map of all quakes. Now adding wildfires and storms takes it to a whole other level. Very glad I use this one!","5"
"492","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Format very basic tons of information I haven’t had any issues with it I’ve been using this app for 4 years","5"
"493","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Like being able to track not only local activity but back in my home state of Montana","5"
"494","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","With family in various places, I love having this app to notify me when quakes hit in specific areas","5"
"495","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The Pacific Rim is lively; and this app also shows you when and where there is current activity.  Lots of fun when it’s nearby.","5"
"496","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is great earthquake app. Any Earthquake we get we know about it. Not a early warning system but fast updates as the Earthquake happens. This app notifies me faster then the built in service. Thank you","5"
"497","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love this app. Not only does it provide up to date Earthquake info but it’s Also Great to learn where Countries are in Our One World!  So the app is Awesome, BUT Why is No one saying Anything about the Current Quakes??! I FEAR FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA!! Today is May6th Please be Careful!","5"
"498","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have notified you previously. The configure alerts page is printed over itself and cannot be accessed/read.  Could you please correct this? Also, how do we set a minimum for earthquake size. App beeps almost continuously when it is set at three Points. I would like to set it up to at least four. Thank you.","2"
"499","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","New update fixed the problem with app crashing!! Thanks!! Glad to give it top marks again!! Really love seeing the earth move around the world in near real time!","5"
"500","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is spot on. Doesn’t miss a beat when it comes to earthquakes. Magnitudes are recorded properly and quickly.

"501","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app gives time location and depth of the quakes, as well as the distance from your location. A+++++","5"
"502","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I truly appreciate the updates and prompt notifications on this app.  Keeping up with all the shaking going on.","5"
"503","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Wide variety of filters","5"
"504","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The only reason it is 4 not 5, is because I can not get alerts to center around my location by 100 miles or less.","4"
"505","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve used this app for as long as I can remember. The new improvements have been great.","5"
"506","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s so nice when you live within the Ring of Fire and experience earthquakes to know fairly immediately the epicenter and how strong it was.","5"
"507","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It would really be nice if the individual could pick what language the labels are in. I don’t know Russian nor Japanese so I don’t know what the labels are saying. It’s very difficult to know the location without the proper language.","4"
"508","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Earthquakes are happening all over the world. Find all the info about all of them. They just added fires too.","5"
"509","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great app to find where earthquakes are happening. Plots distance from your location, severity and depth. Interesting to see local activity in a region.","5"
"510","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I find this a constant and reliable source of information on Earthquakes around the world.","5"
"511","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This free app provides an easy to use interface to look at recent earthquakes in the world or in your local area. You can filter on earthquake magnitude and distance.","5"
"512","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","With family on both coasts and Alaska, having a notice of 5+ lets me know to watch for an “all safe” message and we don’t tie up phone lines unnecessarily.","5"
"513","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Helpful options for setting local alerts >x magnitude vs global alerts >y. Also helpful new features like wildfire smoke tracking.","5"
"514","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like learning about our ever changing planet and this app is great at keeping you up-to-date.  I check it at least twice a day which is good because I live in California and this App helps remind me that I need to be prepared should the big one ever happen.","4"
"515","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I grew up in Los Angeles and still have family there. I like to know where the earthquakes are! Surprisingly there were two nearby in Colorado today!! Scary!","5"
"516","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","My children travel quite a bit, this helps me know how much to worry.","5"

"522","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Downloaded this app before my geology class and got extra credit for it!  Also it’s an excellent way to look at all the movements of this neat lil planet we live on.","5"
"523","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","As soon as anything happens QuakeFeed let’s me know. I live in CA so it’s good to know if something happens as soon as it does. It shows quakes around the world so that’s always good to keep up on. Love this app!","5"
"524","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is dead on it. Accurate and Dependable is the best way to describe This App. I give it a 10 of 10. Thanks For having such accurate Data !","5"
"525","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Does what it says without annoying popup ads, gives the needed info for studying seismic activity","5"
"526","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like being informed at the moment it happens. I’ve had the app for a few years now.","5"
"527","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love this app because of how fast it uploads the Earthquakes magnitude since California has been experiencing aftershocks from the MG7.1 earthquake I know how far the Earthquake is from where I live this is the best app for the most recent earthquakes","5"
"528","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","With sound ads on top of it!  Subscription not worthy of the price when there are many apps that provide very same information for free without any restriction or ads.    I get it there is no free lunch but full page ads just show developer into more greed than quality of their app.  Static small apps are fine, non intrusive and don’t affect app performance.","1"
"529","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is extremely easy to read. I like it, because it doesn't have details, it cuts to the chase. Thank you all.","5"
"530","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","2013 was the last year this app rocked. Once they sold out to GPDR or whatever the hell it is they made the interface overly complicated and too convoluted to use without using huge amounts of cellular data in the pursuit of making more money.   They forgot how they got there in the first place.. they aren’t the #1 one earthquake app in my book anymore and I’ve deleted it after 9?years of loving it.","1"
"531","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","When it comes to seismic disturbances this app is second to none.","5"
"532","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Very interesting app. It gives a great baseline and allows you to give feedback for research. Fun to guess magnitude and wait for it to pop up.","5"
"533","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I appreciate the constant information on this app. Living in California it’s a necessity!","5"
"534","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love how easy it is to see all the quakes around the world and the fault lines, and to click links for more information as needed.","5"
"535","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app is great! It even sends you a notification if an earthquake was in ur area! And not just ur city but a 100 mile radius (or something). It really does send them too.","5"
"536","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Have had this for years.   Good to know when and where things are shaking up.   Find out first, don’t wait for the news.","5"
"537","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great to have. Thanks for getting this APP going. Just need to get all the family to read. Understand and be ready when the big one comes. Thanks again!","4"
"538","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’m an earthquake nerd. Love this app cause the pro version has multiple views, it’s not crazy expensive and I can nerd out anytime I want. Plus no ads. Worth the upgrade!","5"
"539","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app is a good informational source however I really don’t want to see what quakes are happening across the world.  I want to see what is going in in my quake ridden area.  If I need to upgrade to premium, it’s not worth it for a monthly or yearly charge.","3"
"540","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Your alert source for seismic activity worldwide. When you visit the ring of fire, it becomes essential information!","5"
"541","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Worth a spot on your phone if you are interested in quake info from around the world or in your neighborhood.","5"
"542","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have an alarm set at 6.0. When I get a notification, I check to see if a large quake occurred near anybody I know. If so, I email a screenshot to warn them about possible danger.","5"
"543","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Since this app got new updates, it is now my favorite earthquake app to use. I hope with mine and everybody else’s premium service, this app will alway be functional. Keep up the good work guys.","5"
"544","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","We had a 7.2 earlier today and keep getting them every 10/15 minutes and this app tells me exactly where and when!","5"
"545","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love this app, I’m not into the science behind earthquakes at all but I like seeing where they are, recently I haven’t been able to open the app though. It crashes as soon as I open it and I can’t get into it at all","4"
"546","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I don’t understand why since we started getting earthquakes in Puerto Rico, I get the notifications, but not all the esrthquake events don’t show in the list. My settings are correct. Triple checked.  Sometimes they take an hour to show. I am puzzled and scared. I rely in this App to be informed.","2"
"547","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like that it’s accurate and easy to use. Recommend this app. If you could set alerts to a .5 instead of just full points would be really great","5"
"548","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love checking out the locations of quakes. I’ve never heard of many places so I go online to learn a bit of history of these places! Check out Big Diomede and Little Diomede Islands!","5"
"549","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Had you guys for years and trusted you until this earthquake only 2 miles away , but you say was 50 miles from where I live, you just lost 100 percent credibility with fake info, how did you ever stay in business doing this crap? One star must place otherwise cannot do this review . Totally unbelievable .","1"
"550","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s amazing to see really how many earthquakes are taking place in one place after another that you wouldn’t hear about if it weren’t for this real time app.","5"
"551","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This used to be a great app but now, just in the last week or so, it keeps crashing. I really liked having the notifications, but I can’t even open the app. What a disappointment.  Looks like it is working after the fix... guess we’ll see...","3"
"552","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","There are times I’m not sure if it was an earthquake or just a loud truck driving by and now I can determine this, thank you!","5"
"553","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","My family lives in Japan. This apps helps me when Japan has earthquake. If it is close to my parents place.","5"
"554","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s really good to know what’s going on on in the world around us. And keeps our heads up to know what’s going on and what we should be looking for out here  in Alaska.","5"
"555","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love it because I can be anywhere and I don’t miss anything I still receive my alert 🚨 plus is very reliable","5"
"556","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love! It keep me inform of what it happening in the world! No adds not bugging around, very accurate, it is interesting for me to know early in the morning what is going on! Thanks!","5"

"559","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love to find out where the earthquakes are it keeps me up-to-date. I know that sounds strange but it’s something that I like to track.","5"
"560","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","When theEarth moves I get a notification such as my parameters it’s a nice way to teach geography and earth science to high school students when we get earthquake alerts.","5"
"561","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is such a great app. I get alerted as soon as there’s an earthquake. I can set the notifications to whatever I prefer, such as notifying me only if there’s a magnitude of 4.0 and above.","5"
"562","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Very informative however I wish there was a way I can sing allow my particular state","5"
"563","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I'm an L.A. Resident and am accustomed to thinking about earth movements only in my home territory.  This app gives me the global view of our constantly moving planet and a real appreciation for the science of  seismology.","5"
"564","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","So thankful to have this App., especially here in Alaska where we have far too many quakes! Thank you for keeping me and my family updated...","5"
"565","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I do not like or want this new method of reporting earthquakes.  Please do not assume that everyone does. Please, if there is any way I can monitor data, without upgrading, let me know.","5"
"566","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’d like to have months of history showing instead of the last two days.","5"
"567","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","When I tried to click on “notification settings” I got a full page advertisement I couldn’t click out of. As a result, I was unable to change my notification settings.","3"
"568","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Very quick notification of Earthquakes, the magnitude & location, great preparation information and superb Tsunami Watch! Being involved in emergency preparedness, I highly value this app!","5"
"569","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like this app because it tells you when it hits an earthquake. At least it gives you an urgent earthquake alert. It’s a good app.","5"
"570","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I just barely got the app and it says too allow or not allow your location and every time I get on that it just kicks me off and goes back to the home screen","4"
"571","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Gives you real-time alerts on where the quake is and how strong it is","5"
"572","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Thank you for your continued info & support. We moved to Santa Barbara recently from Chicago. Obviously we are on edge w our recent disasters an C","5"
"573","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’m disappointed that the maps are in foreign languages. I went to look at the earthquakes in Japan and pretty much have no idea where anything is. I don’t read Japanese characters. Can you use maps annotated in English?","3"
"574","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Totally awesome. Brings out the science geek in me. Wish I had this info when teaching. My kids would have enjoyed seeing quakes in real time.","5"
"575","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is very helpful especially living in Southern California. It is nice to receive this information as soon as it happens with accuracy and precision! Thank you so much!","5"
"576","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Easy to use. Variable settings on the notifications are nice. Only had it for a week, but so far, no complaints at all.","5"
"577","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love the fact that this app sends me notifications!  Have had this for a while now and they keep improving it.","5"
"578","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Never received the notification sound on old app on Apple SE.  Installed new latest Apple SE error message my alerts have error asks me if I want to reset.  I reset since failed to get my sound notification about 7.1 in Phillipines not happy!","2"
"579","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like the app as it gives me information that I don’t like which is “earthquakes!” I’ve lived in California most of my life and earthquakes are never fun but having some knowledge of them helps.","5"
"580","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This was the best app....WAS!! Not any more. I used to get notifications to keep up with my kids in California, now with the update UNLESS you pay $$$ you get nothing. No alerts, NO notifications, nada!! Completely dead. Completely useless- Dutchsince is the only one who cares about keeping people safe and keeping them informed. I won't recommend this app to anyone now. Congratulations -","1"
"581","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Alaska has a lot of earthquakes. Since I got this app it is incredibly fast and reliable. I thoroughly enjoy this app and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone needing to track quakes. P.S. The map layout is amazing! Great job to this developer!","5"
"582","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love this app. Whenever there’s been an earthquake in PR, I have received the notification immediately. I received a notification through The Weather Channel saying there’s been an earthquake in NC of 5.2 and I can’t even open the application to verify where in NC and it opens and immediately CRASHES. Common guys we want to have the information it’s IMPORTANT TO US!! Please FIX IT!","1"
"583","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s a fine app, but has a few features missing that are nice like the radius of earthquakes. Also I get alerts for quakes in my area that don’t show up on the app list and only as an alert so it’s not consistent with itself.","3"
"584","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Just downloaded the app since California is currently experiencing aftershocks after the 7.1 earthquake we felt yesterday night. I’d like to be up to date and keep my family informed so giving this app a try. Thanks!","4"
"585","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","But it does not offer an option for how long it keeps quake data. The data appears to go away after only 24 hrs with no way to recall historical information for a selected area over longer periods. Not even a week or month.","3"
"586","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Pretty awesome program.  The only thing I would love to see in the Stats is earthquake duration time. That would be very useful information.","5"
"587","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Appreciate being notified of earthquakes and their details.  Also like the ability to report impact when users experience earthquakes firsthand.","4"
"588","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","There are banner ads that you can’t delete that obscure part of the maps. Annoying.  Great app otherwise.","4"
"589","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","We live in CA so we have this just to know what’s going on in the region, it’s also probably good from an educational standpoint to see how much activity there is globally at any one time.","4"
"590","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Quake feed keeps the world informed on where all the earthquake action happens! Good to know what is happening underground in my area and if future quake insurance may be a good idea!","5"
"591","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app is just fantastic! It gives you immediate quake information even before it is reported by a major news outlet.","5"
"592","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Very easy to set up.  Instantly alerts you when there is a an earthquake as defined in the areas and magnitude that you set up. Great free app!","5"
"593","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","App crashes and won’t load after latest update. Still works on my iPhone 6 but crashes on my iPhone X.","5"
"594","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","You don’t realize how many earthquakes are happening everyday. Information is updated quickly.","5"
"595","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s always interesting to hear that signal going off that there has been activity and then to find out how far away.","5"
"596","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Thank you for this app! It’s a good way to educate myself and keep up with family and friends around the world and what they’re  experiencing. I had no idea we live in such an “ active” world.","5"
"597","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Last update made it much more difficult to review multiple quakes. For ONE quake it’s better...  overall have been using it for a couple of years and really like it","4"
"598","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great app, however the lack of a custom alert sound negates the value of using this app! Please enable custom notification sounds, and you have a 5 star app! Will say this app is great for alerts, and worth every penny","4"
"599","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Despite messaging the app developers twice with info to verify which family I am part of.","5"
"600","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’m in Utah. I have used this app for the recent earthquake we had and the aftershocks we are experiencing. The app does not have an updated list of all the quakes and aftershocks we are experiencing out here.. please update!    Aftershocks are still being felt but they aren’t listed.... do you know that your missing things??","2"
"601","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I've bought something I can't use, and they have no support to help!! This is ridiculous!!!","5"
"602","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","What criteria is there that some earthquakes are removed from the list after a notification.  Very disappointed app doesn’t keep all notifications or give reason for removing a earthquake","3"
"603","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Recommended this in the local scanner group so that everyone can track quakes without tying up scanner traffic.  Quick and accurate!","5"
"604","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a great app, it really keeps us informed. Especially all the resent activity we’ve been having lately in Ojai California.","5"
"605","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Like the map feature on each quake. Like to be able to filter size of quake.","5"
"606","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Always so accurate and love to be able to see the location and other quakes in the region","5"
"607","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Thank you for always sharing timely information.","5"
"608","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I read it every day while living in California, it’s just something I love about the earth moving. Thanks","5"
"609","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love it!  As a mining engineer/geologist I have always been fascinated with earthquakes - first one I ever experienced in person was in Southern Illinois over fifty years ago.  The asphalt parking lot was rolling in waves.","5"
"610","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love this app!! It’s so informative. I really enjoy knowing what natural phenomena is going on around the world. I’m glad it has links to get more information.","5"
"611","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve used this app since it’s launch. It’s accurate, fast, and ez to navigate. The ad’s are static, placed in the list of quakes. They aren’t distracting or annoying. Great app!","5"
"612","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’m in Alaska and I got a few earthquake apps after I felt my first earthquake and this is the only one I still have. That should say enough","5"
"613","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","If you want to be on the know and stay on top of what’s shaking (literally). This is the most accurate and reliable app on Earth. Thank you QuakeFeed!","5"
"614","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","For the average geological enthusiast, this app is great! The data is near real time for when USGS release their readings. Haven’t tried the wildfire integration yet, but probably will soon.","5"
"615","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","We live in a high earthquake area and this app is critical in keeping informed. Accurate and responsive within moments of the event.","5"
"616","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The upgrades are worth it, takes the app to thd next level. I loved it before, now its truly great!","5"
"617","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I check earthquakes around the world daily. This is a great app for this. Keeps you in the know for what’s happening around us that really matters.","5"
"618","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I look at it each day","5"
"619","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Alerts are real time and accurate. Very interesting.","5"
"620","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have family all over the world,  so QuakeFeed is a good resource to have. The Maps are very useful to hone in on exactly where quakes are, and the running list is a handy tool at a glance.","5"
"621","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Quick feed & info when you need it. Finding out it’s really the earthquakes waking me & not me being an insomniac. Times coincide with my wake up or the dog waking me.","5"
"622","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s nice to get earthquake info from around the world within minutes of the event. Living on the fault line this helps keep us aware.","5"
"623","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Simple way to stay informed. Very easy to navigate. I can filter to get more information or less depending on what I am researching. Excellent, very pleased.","5"
"624","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I can get notification right after the event and have a good idea of how impactful it is. It have an excellent filtering system so I can filter out minor quakes or focus on more local quakes.","5"
"625","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The latest version does not work. App will open for one second then quits.  Bug was recently fixed! Back to 5 stars.","5"
"626","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Hi, I'm from Puerto Rico and recently we are having a lot of earthquakes. I have this app a long time ago to see the earthquakes near me, but now everytime that we have one earthquake the app it's notifying me the earthquakes ten or more minutes later... i know that you can't predict it but, YOU CAN DO BETTER.","3"
"627","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Good for checking out EQ info and getting local alerts. But then hard to find specific info on alerts and have to click practically everything on the screen to find something.","3"
"628","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Works pretty well. Looks like tons of people have been using it so it crashed which was not good with all these big ones happening though. I would give it 5 stars if it didn’t lag!","4"
"629","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have had this app for a while now and I really like it. I live in Idaho and the West Coast shakes a lot. I have family in Oregon, Nevada and California so it's nice to keep up with what the Earth is doing here in the Western part of the US.","5"
"630","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is my favorite quake app but I’m starting to look elsewhere because of the lack of support for full screen iPhone X. Every other app on my phone has been updated. Please make an update soon!","4"
"631","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great app just wish I could isolates what I want to see not just earthquakes and fires but only storms or only volcanoes and such","5"
"632","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Up to date information about earthquakes and tsunamis! I live in earthquake country so I need to be sure a tsunami isn’t headed our way!","5"
"633","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I would not change one thing","5"
"634","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love this app.  I check it several times a day. You never know when that big one will hit.","5"

"639","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It is Amazing how many earthquakes there are on the world that you don’t even know about, till you get this app!!","5"
"640","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Who would have though Kansas and Oklahoma would be as active as California with earthquake. This is a great app for monitoring earthquakes with adjustable notifications.","5"
"641","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’m a Nature Science nut so keeping up with stuff like this makes me tingle lol. As a matter of fact there was just a 4.0 earthquake 8mi away in Lennox, CA that shook the house 3 mins ago that prompted me to leave a review. Keep up the great work!","5"
"642","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Alaska is home to many earthquakes. I am always concerned about quake activity all over the world. I am grateful to have updates in real time so that I can keep the victims-human and animals-in my heart.","5"

"644","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Never gave it much thought of needing earthquake information in the middle Atlantic but after a earthquake a couple of years ago a five point me I guess we do check out videos of the Washington Monument during that really cool😄","4"
"645","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Has been using it for several years and pretty accurate. Often time before news.","5"
"646","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I don’t like the new map colors. They are too washed out. The old colors and contrast were much better. Return to the old maps and colors and you’ll earn back the lost fifth star.","4"
"647","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Not sure if this is technically possible, but can the early warning system be added to this app?","5"
"648","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It was so much easier to use before.  For example,  Now it’s  a 3 step process to switch sources.   Before it was one click.  Info on earthquakes  now takes half the page, it was so much more visually practical the smaller boxes.  Night-mode, doesn’t work.    Overall,  this version is a downgrade.","2"
"649","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Still love this app after many years of use, but there’s no Watch hookup. Pls add. I really don’t want to start over with a new app but alerts on my watch save me from phone hyperfocus","4"

"659","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","We live in a high quake area with friends around the world also living in high quake areas so this app is indispensable. If you live in a quake prone area this app is especially useful.","5"
"660","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I do not like the latest update. It is very difficult to enlarge the map to see details on number of quakes in the same location. I do not care for the embedded advertisement in the list of quakes. Just terrible. I will be looking for a different app.","2"

"677","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Hello Quake Staff! Love Your Service .  We live by the notifications. The special pings of two rings  are unique enough that when heardnWe know there's been a a earthquake. All the best, Dr. Frankie","5"
"678","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The alerts allow me to know where the earthquake that I felt was centered.","5"

"684","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is accurate and I haven’t had any problems to speak of after having it for over a year.","5"
"685","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app is good in that it allows me to set parameters to my needs and interest. However, I wish I could figure out how to read some of the maps so I could learn as much as possible.","4"
"686","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I loved this app because you could choose regions and magnitudes within separate regions. The newest update only allows you to choose a magnitude worldwide. I only care about earthquakes near me that are larger than 4. But i also care about earthquakes around the world that are larger than 7. I can’t believe they would take features away. Silly.","1"
"687","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Just downloaded your App and it was not long before I received notice of an Earthquake in Central America where I have many friends and family members.","5"
"688","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a very useful and very informative app. It is easily customizable to provide the exact information you wish to see.","5"
"689","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","If you need to be up to date with this kind of information this app is a must have. Free version is very precise, full version for $5 a year is awesome.","5"
"690","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","There are times I find the alerts annoying, truly that is when I need to be watching!","5"
"691","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love this app! I suggest buying a sub for a year too - well worth the $$$. My only concern is I may not be getting ALL quakes - but Zi also know it’s pulling from the USBS, I mean, USGS, who d/n always show the earthquakes......so not this app’s fault. LOVE IT!! THANK YOU!!!!!","5"

"702","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Previously lived in Los Angeles with family still there. Have a fascination with earthquakes. This app lets me know as soon as a quake happens. Can personalize to size and location for notifications. I love it","5"
"703","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have had ap for 5 years. It is reliable with detailed info and quick links to USGS and other info.","5"
"704","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is not a warning app. It notifies 10 to 15 minutes after event passed, not at the text speed expected become today’s technological advancements. I was at least expecting to be alerted immediately after seismograph felt it. Look for a network app where people click when they feel it and you’ll know sooner than with this app. WASTE OF TIME AND EFFORT AND PREMIUM VERSION IS THE SAME SH— BUT W/OUT THE ADS.","1"
"705","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love knowing immediately when we have an earthquake!  This app is great in getting the information out ASAP!  I have been using this for years.","5"

"710","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","As I have relatives living in earthquake and volcanic regions, I find this app to be invaluable.  Despite being invaluable, it is actually inexpensive!","5"
"711","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This used to be an awesome app. Now all it does is crash the moment I open it. I tried to contact developer support about it, but that page doesn't exist anymore. Too bad, i would have upgraded to the paid version, but not now that the app doesn't work. Please, if you can, fix this problem and I will give a better rating.","1"
"712","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Easy to use and quickly updated to ser the latest quake info.","5"

"715","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s really important to have this as we live in a area where the earthquakes are expected.","5"
"716","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","When the 5.1 hit Ojai Ca on Aug 20, 2023 Quake Feed posted accurate information prior to the Emergency warning notices and the local news station. My “go to” source.","4"
"717","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Very accurate and quick. Has pleasing graphics.","5"
"718","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It gives me the information with maps and other great information. Easy to use and set to your specifications.","4"

"720","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Yes, the ad bug is fixed and I can use the app again! Thanks so much for the timely fix! Love this app!!! 😁😁","5"
"721","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I thought I felt a earthquake and sure enough a minute or two later I got the alert from the app.","5"
"722","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Terrific updates , right on spot notifications. Easy to use app","5"
"723","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It gets the lately information about the earth. When I felt my ground May have shook, I jumped to this app to verify.","5"
"724","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love this earthquake app the most. The maps, the fault lines, time stamps, the alert sound, it has it all.","5"
"725","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","My friends have told me I’m hyper sensitive sometimes I think there’s an earthquake and I look on the earthquake app and it did  happened in China!!!","5"
"726","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This App keeps me informed and has detailed information and goes directly to the map where it happened. It also gives Tsunami warnings.","5"
"727","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love this app, but had to turn off sound notifications because new alert is too distracting.","5"
"728","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The wide variety of filters allow me to only be notified when a quake could impact me.  Would recommend this app","5"
"729","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I loved the old version of this app, but this new version is terrible.  The maps don’t load.  I’ve never had to upgrade to premium before and if that’s what the USGS wants then I’m through with this app.  I wish people would not fix what wasn’t broken to begin with.  I’m deleting this from my devices and just looking up earthquakes via Google.","1"
"730","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Now I can’t see my location.  The new interface is hokey,  Ever since it updated it’s telling me to upgrade to an ad-free version I thought I already had a license for.  My Location is no longer displaying, I have all the location settings to show it, but it’s faulty.","2"
"731","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","For people who have been subscribing for as long as I have, the original subscription cost should be grandfathered. I’m not paying 5x the cost. Will delete first. Bummer. It is one of my most often used apps, seeing as how an 8.1 took place 25 miles from me in 2018 and it was a comfort to monitor the aftershocks.   Not paying more. Not for one of this app’s longest loyal subscribers.","1"
"732","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","One of the perfect app which gives comprehensive and authentic information about earthquake around the world.","5"
"733","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Porn ad comes up while looking at your app","5"
"734","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I would have given it a five star rating. As far as I’m concerned the one missing bit of information would be how long the quake lasted.","5"
"735","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve used this APP for years but, somewhere along the way of updates, I lost the ability to click on the Tsunami warning Icon to view information. That’s important to me because, I live near the Columbia River, and it’s near the Oregon coast.","3"
"736","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have loved this app since the beginning. It gets better and better. Great way to explore part of earth science. Happy to support Global Artisan with a premium purchase.","5"
"737","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","App was working great at first! I would get alerts 3 minutes BEFORE the local news alerts (so awesome!). But for the past week, alerts haven been delayed an hour. Local news alert would pop up then I go check the app and there is no record of the recent quake...until an hour later. Pointless. Side note: I live in Hawaii.","1"
"738","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love this app. Even before it was upgraded, I would check the world daily. I es- pecially note the Oklahoma and Kansas tremors caused by fracking. So much for relatives in Kansas who are afraid of California quakes. The new improvements are awesome.","5"
"739","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Missing a few earthquakes or late updates.","4"
"740","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like how fast the earthquake reporting is. No guessing. Also like all the detailed information on the map.","5"

"746","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app provides timely data when we experience a quake. Very helpful!","5"
"747","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Missing faults. No names to faults. Many smaller earthquakes are now missing from map. New users will never know how much better this app was before the update when so much functionality was lost in the name of cheaper change.","2"
"748","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love this app.  We have hundreds of earthquakes where we live and appreciate the alerts when there is one.","5"
"749","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love feeling a quake and getting the info in less than 10 minutes","5"
"750","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is my “go-to” when I want to know anything about quakes, fires, and more. Highly recommended","5"

"754","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I wish we could get 3 minutes warning, but this app gives  few seconds warning.","5"
"755","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Had this for a few years and It always accurate. Living in California, it’s nice to know where the earthquakes are. I can’t find a single FAULT with this app! A+++","5"
"756","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is great!  It updates every quake, everywhere, regardless of size, before the news even reports it.","5"
"757","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have notifications set up so I’m aware of any large earthquake. Also, living in CA I look at the app frequently for earthquake swarms or just to be aware of what’s going on.","5"
"758","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is elegant and its simplicity and gives you all the information you need to know.","5"

"760","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I like how it shows the earthquake happening all over the world! Thanks for the daily updates and notifications!","5"
"761","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","The app works very well.","5"
"762","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","After having a 5.8 earthquake in our area on a fault line that was not previously mapped, it's nice to have an app to keep track of the activity in our area.","5"
"763","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love this app and have my family use it too in case we have an earthquake they will be alerted as well.","5"
"764","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Alerts are good but can’t pull up places I want like before.  I think this was changed a while back and I just put up with it.","4"
"765","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Does what is expected with accuracy and clarity. Great graphics. Easy to use.","5"
"766","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Perfect for real-time and objective doom scrolling. And planning for where to not live and where to live as climate changes.","5"
"767","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is a straightforward, clean design and is an incredibly useful tool for checking out geological activity. It's a must have app for any Californian!","5"
"768","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I enjoyed the simplicity and only wanted to view earthquakes at the specific magnitude that I wanted to see. Now I can’t seem to navigate through all the extra stuff that I don’t care to see on an app for earthquakes. I have other apps for that extra stuff. Keep it simple.  Boooooo……","1"
"769","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve always been interested and studied Earth studies and live close to a mountain who is overdue for eruption. This is very informative site I enjoy very much, Thanks","5"

"778","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love the maps showing different aspects of seismic activity locally or around the world.","5"
"779","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Excellent, easy to understand information. The world map with the different earthquake line breaks helps a lot.","5"
"780","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Very accurate and provides useful information, on several occasions was invaluable to understand risk of avalanche when traveling in the snow ladened mountains of Alaska.","5"
"781","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Great site! Gives you many different ways to see the activity and location.","5"
"782","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Updates need to be posted faster online","5"

"788","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","It’s super interesting to see all the quakes happening everywhere before news outlets report them.","5"
"789","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","When ever an earthquake hits it is good to look at your map to see where it is and how close it id to us in Tennessee","5"
"790","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Now, not much.  I liked being able to see the map that shows where and the size of an earthquake.  Many times, I do not recognize the places listed in the world.  It helped me expand my knowledge of geography.  No map, no further education.  I’m sad.  This may be the next app I delete.","1"
"791","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I have been using it for a long time. I’m an amateur Geologist and just totally geek out on it!! You can track the upcoming apocalypse!!","5"
"792","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Just had a quake and it came up right away. Love this. I think everyone should try it out!!","5"
"793","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I really enjoy the features that let me look at map to pin point locations.","5"

"796","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I usually don’t know that I’m using the app until I need it or a big quake goes off somewhere","5"
"797","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This was a great app, but with the latest update you don't just get banner ads which are fine, you also get forced full page pop up ads which is incredibly obtrusive and annoying. Deleted and back to USGS on my browser.","2"
"798","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Data is very easy to organize by the region and data of your interest.","5"
"799","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I enjoy notifications of quakes through out the world and especially in my area. It keeps me on alert.","5"
"800","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I really like this app. However, this is twice in less than a year that suddenly I no longer have an option to select the information button to get more information on an earthquake. It’s suddenly grayed out. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app.","2"
"801","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I live in Hawaii.  Being surrounded by the ring of fire you need every second u can get to prepaid Fia tsunamis.  QuakeFeed always notifies me faster than any emergency system in place.","5"
"802","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This is a great app but it takes too long to notify of an earthquake. My notification came about 20 minutes late.","4"
"803","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I love this app but version 4.1.5 has issues with Location Services. For every hour I’m on the road it uses 100MB of data through Location Services. In 2 weeks it’s used 2GB of data on my cell phone plan. I’ve had to shut down Location Services until the app is fixed! Im using iOS 11.4.","1"
"804","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is great, if you just want the up to date news in earthquake, size and where this is the app for you.","5"

"808","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Always was excellent.  Count on it.","5"
"809","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Get instant notifications when there’s an earthquake. See the location on a map. I love this app.","5"

I wonder why?","1"
"946","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Set your location and you’ll get notifications 🤩","5"

"955","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Telling me there was an earthquake 4 min after I fell out of bed isn't much of an alert. This app is good to inform you if something happened around the world to a loved one. You’ll know within 5 min. But this app won’t save you.","3"
"956","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Set notification filter at 4.0, and I’m getting notifications below 4, that take me to the app and show me nothing because it’s below 4.  This just started happening last update...","3"

"1489","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I noticed that when I get alerts the app tells me where the quake is but when I open the app there are no location markers showing up. Is there something wrong or do I have to pay for map markers?","1"

"1491","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","This app is nice but I think it needs faster updates on when the quake or aftershocks actually happen.","3"
"1492","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I tried to filter the feed just now to narrow it to my area as I had a bodily reaction I only get when there’s a quake. Narrowed the distance to 100 miles. It still is showing me items across the Pacfic. That’s thousands of miles. I wanted only 100.","1"
"1493","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Time zone isn’t accurate so reading the data is confusing as to when it actually happened.  Also writing this review was glitchy.","2"
"1494","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Love the maps, locations vs known faults.","5"
"1495","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I thought that the ads would be an acceptable trade off for evaluating this app.  I simply opened the preferences and was blasted by some obscene ad at maximum volume which I could not stop without killing the app.    Deleting this piece of junk until the author can come to his or her senses.","1"

"1498","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","I’ve lived in SoCal since the 60’s & I will never get used to the earthquakes ~ they scare the crap out of me. Now we have CRAZY WILDFIRES! I usually go to USGS website for info when I think I’ve felt something (yes, I’m old, lol) ~ mainly because it’s so difficult finding any news out of Orange County! I found this app when I bought my first iPhone, and loved how easy it was to use! With the consistent drought in the west ~ with no end in sight ~ and the record breaking fires we now have to live with, there’s NO REASON NOT TO PAY FOR the PREMIUM VERSION of this App!! It’s super easy to set up & use. It’s completely user friendly & can be customized for your particular needs! It will alert me only for what I want. I haven’t found any downside to this app. They’re working on new features to make it even better than it already is! The ONLY thing I would suggest is for more Map options in premium, but that’s only because I get bored. If you live in a drought area… If you live in a fire area… If you live on or near a fault zone… If you just want to stay informed on these things… Buy the Premium Version of this App! It’s GREAT! ***QUESTION/SUGGESTION 4 ADMINS***  Would it be possible to add information on the actual duration of a quake?? At the epicenter, of course. I know that the whenever we’re actually experiencing one, it FEELS like they last several minutes - which I know isn’t true. But it takes a few HOURS for me to feel steady after one. I’ve never been able to find this detail anywhere. It’s just something that would be helpful to me. Thanks!","5"

"1736","QuakeFeed Earthquake Tracker","Since initially complaining about map display dysfunction, causing maps and sometimes incident reports to suddenly vanish, then reappear the following day or two, I have received kind and comprehensive responses from the developers, and the displays seem to have stabilized satisfactorily. All much appreciated. Though not exactly as ideal as I'd hoped for, at least I now understand why, and am satisfied they've done their best to provide a useful and efficient overview of quake and wildfire events, as well as possible with the data streams available to incorporate into the app. So I've updated to reflect a good/satisfactory rating. Though my idealized concept of an app like this may not be fully achievable, I figure it wouldn't be a bad idea to leave it here, as what I'd wish for, to make it truly a 5 Star utility app...  ...Hope to see faster, more immediately reported and simply described listings, a single coherent settings menu, and perhaps a less-detailed average consumer/kid-friendly default setting, more like a local newscast weather report. Danger coming? Passed and All Clear now? How threatening? Relax, or prepare to Evacuate? Would appreciate a simplified green-yellow-red type of quick glance right at launch, and from there explore deeper into specific geological survey details if interested. Immediacy and Simplicity could really make a difference, when quick data and response can save lives and property...  As the kind of up-to-the-minute wildfire updates vital to neighborhoods under possible threat is still only accessible through cumbersome hard to navigate government website pages via internet browsers - which keep resetting back to Welcome menu with each session, wasting all that vital reaction time to click through the same menus again for each individual device to reestablish location of concern and map display settings, I will just have to wait and hope that that live stream source will one day be incorporated into a quick and simple Red, Yellow, Green notification/alert feature in an app like this. Meanwhile, I appreciate QuakeFeed for all the work being done to make it as useful and functional as it is presently. Thanks for all that, and I will look forward to future developments.","4"

"1","GeoNet Quake","I live in a city with almost daily quakes.  This app is really useful! Have it on my phone and iPad.","5"
"2","GeoNet Quake","A helpful app. But now all the impact/magnitude ratings are indicated by different shades of orange. Really bad design choice. Now it's hard to scan rapidly for higher impact events and I'm forced to use filters - losing the context. Did you guys test this? With who? Please fix the colors.","3"
"3","GeoNet Quake","I like this app, works quite good, very basic interface, maybe a bit too basic, however! I expect the app to grow in time.","4"
"4","GeoNet Quake","Thank you, GNS Science, this is absolutely super.","5"
"1","LastQuake","This app is definitely one of the best out there! Every time a significant earthquake occurs, this app will almost immediately add it to their database! Not only that, but the app allows users to submit “felt reports”, in which users who have felt the quake can report their experiences, such as how it felt like and what kind of effects the earthquake caused (damages and such). I find that feature amazing. Also, if the earthquake was strong enough to cause a potential tsunami, this app links you to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center’s website, so you can assess the risk!   These are just some of the features you can find on the app. Overall, it’s an amazing app, and you should definitely download it if you live in an earthquake prone area, or even if you are just interested by earthquakes in general.   Thank you EMSC for your service!","5"
"2","LastQuake","It’s a great app that allows people to post what they felt when they felt it. People never fails to amaze me that they feel the need to pipe up and post that they didn’t feel a thing, or never heard it, as if trying to say the earthquake never happened or was nothing, these “people” all live 100 to 200 miles away from it. apparently they have never actually looked at the app and realize that their location in miles is also posted along with their comment,Other than these “people” it’s a great app. AngieMcMac","5"
"3","LastQuake","Living in a state which has an average of 20,000+ temblors with at least one one 7.0+ annually, I check ESRI almost as frequently as my favorite weather app.  The info on their site is updated quickly, and they encourage people to share their experiences and photos.  It’s always an interesting read, how differently others nearby have perceived the same event, possibly based on local substrates - bedrock, gravel, clay, and permafrost. Recommend highly.","5"
"4","LastQuake","I like this app but I wish I would get notifications for quakes for my area ONLY, with a warning sound. I don’t need to know there was a large earthquake in Indonesia.. I’m in the Southern California desert. I do like how the map shows more earthquakes worldwide than USGS shows, but I wish they were better color coded by size and timeline like they are on USGS. Overall it’s a good app, but I was looking for an app to give me an alert for quakes in my area, which it has sometimes, but like I said, I don’t need to know about earthquakes worldwide. I can look at the map and see for myself. If the San Andres or surrounding faults are acting up near me and I need to prepare, that’s when I want a heads up!","3"
"5","LastQuake","I always keep the app for earthquakes up. It is organized very well. I can quickly see where the most recent earthquakes are all over the world. When I lived in an area that had earthquakes I reported a couple. I was not ever aware that there were so many earthquakes happening all over the world until I used this app. It has opened my eyes to how many and some are big. It has been educational.","5"
"6","LastQuake","LastQuake provides rapid, accurate information on earthquakes and tsunamis throughout the world. One of my family members had traveled worldwide in the past. Keeping abreast of earthquakes through this app helped me feel less anxious for her safety. The tremendous increase in frequency of earthquakes such as is happening now in Iceland should be of great concern to all of us. Thank you so much!","5"
"7","LastQuake","LastQuake has been a surge of prompt, reliable information during the Albanian earthquakes. It helped to restore some sense of control to have the knowledge and insight that the app provides during a time of such uncertainty.   A side benefit - As anyone who has lived through earthquakes knows, “phantom quakes” (imagined shaking) can feel quite real. It was nice to be able to quickly open the app to see when it’s all in my head!","5"
"8","LastQuake","I like having this app to get important information about earthquakes like magnitude, location, and depth but it frequently does not notify me of earthquakes near me. It does tell me about strong earthquakes around the world, but seems to ignore my loval settings inconsistently, not notifying me more often than it does. However, I am happy with the information it provides even if I have to go and find it myself.","4"
"9","LastQuake","very happy I got this app. I live in an earthquake prone zone, and this App has given me a lot of accurate information about earthquakes, esp in my area. It’s very helpful in trying to plan for the next big one, which we are assured will come. I lived through the 1990s huge earthquake in Los Angeles, and I certainly don’t want to be as unplanned as we were in those days. I would recommend this earthquake app to everyone.","5"
"10","LastQuake","LastQuake is the best of several apps I’ve tried to get good, up-to-date info on earthquakes. I live in California, so this is important to me. You can customize it to only notify you of quakes above a certain strength. During July 2019, when there was a series of earthquakes in southern Calif, it was the first app to notify me and provided good maps and even reports from users in SoCal who experienced shaking.","5"
"11","LastQuake","So Kool being able to get almost real time alerts of earthquakes. Wished I had this app while growing up in the high desert in California. Would have made a huge difference with all the earthquakes we had while I was growing up. We didn’t have cellphones so but still would have been great to have. Appreciate these people for this app thank you.","5"
"12","LastQuake","Before I had this app, I had no idea there was at least one earthquake per day in California. It’s just interesting to know what is happening in the world around you. It also has a great feature where you can send information such as did you feel it and how strong did it feel to you. Highly recommended.","5"
"13","LastQuake","After having a small earthquake at our home we became interested in knowing more about when and where they happen. This is a great app that lets me know when one happens and where. Often much faster than any news agency or other information agency. Tsunami information link ks excellent too.","5"
"14","LastQuake","I was pleased with this app before. Then we had a 6.7 near us and the app quit working!  I was wanting to monitor after-shocks but could only get the spinning wheel. Looking for a new app. I do not recommend this one. Found out they are a not for profit organization. I will raise my rating to three stars, but you have to be able to handle the traffic!  When we need you most after an earthquake the app needs to work! Going back to a one star rating. The spinning wheel is all you get when you are affected by a quake near you. Don’t bother with this until it is fixed!","1"
"15","LastQuake","A couple of years ago when Kilauea started erupting my journey with earthquakes began.. volcanos led me to this earthquake app. Immediate up to date information is given and I enjoy reading the comments from the people who have actually experienced any earthquake movement that has happened.  Good maps gives the precise location of the earthquake and range. Well worth the upgrade!","5"
"16","LastQuake","Wonderful app! Nice interface, very easy rating of quake intensity (good for when uou’re literally shaken up), fast. Can sometimes crash after a big quake due to too many people trying to access it, but then I just look at their twitter feed which is connected to the app and website, and still get all the info! Keep up the great work y’all!!","5"
"17","LastQuake","We experience regular earthquakes in our area. It’s important for me to know where the epicenter is located. I get notification through this app fairly fast. I’ve been using this app for a few years and will continue using it and reporting data.","5"
"18","LastQuake","This app is amazing in that you can know what is happening all over the globe regarding earthquakes at any given time. You know exactly how long ago and how severe an earthquake was. You can select to know about all quakes or just near you. The option to report if you felt a quake is available too.","5"
"19","LastQuake","After a big quake in my city, this app helped me track the aftershocks. It was reassuring to be able to see right away if the rumbling was a quake or construction noise. It’s also been reassuring to see how alive the crust is - a quake somewhere in the world every day. It helps me to feel part of something bigger, instead of feeling isolated in my panic!","5"
"20","LastQuake","I love this app! Especially living in California-if I feel an earthquake I immediately go to the app to find the details.  It is remarkable how quickly they have the data.  I also like that you can see information on earthquakes worldwide.  I have also contributed data through the “I felt an earthquake “ section.","5"
"21","LastQuake","Font size of the text (at the right of Magnitude) giving details like how many minutes before the quake happened need to be a little bigger, because while color characters on a non-dark background are less readable than dark color characters on white background.","5"
"22","LastQuake","This app is amazing. LastQuake is the most comprehensive guide for tracking earthquakes and gathering information once they happen. It even warns for tsunamis which I have never seen in any other app. People can post what they felt, how long it lasted, ultimately giving scientists more realtime data than just what they read on seismometers.","5"
"23","LastQuake","This is a really interesting and informative app that reports on earthquakes throughout the world. It’s easy to change data parameters to include only earthquakes in a specific area. It also allows users to describe how an earthquake in their general area felt to them.","5"
"24","LastQuake","After the recent California earthquakes, I realized that this App is a great citizens science tool, as so many people reported their experience from the epicenter to over a hundred miles away in all directions. The comments add another dimension of feedback to data gathered from detectors.","5"
"25","LastQuake","Okay but would like to see earthquake depths and locations from me in feet and miles Update. Developers got to me and answered my question within days. Thank you and hope for further updates for this app and other apps in emsc family","5"
"26","LastQuake","Not intrusive, gives all the necessary information, precise, while not overwhelming.  The support is top notch. I had a small question on what I thought was missing data (earthquake not reported in app). Got immediate answer. Can’t ask for more. Thanks!","5"
"27","LastQuake","I love this app. I live in Northern California an extremely active seismic area where having accurate knowledge of current earthquakes can provide me with info to determine what is in the near future for my area. United States Geographical Survey ( USGS ) is not dependable/responsible for accurate reporting so I rely heavily on this agency and am so grateful for all it’s options.","5"
"28","LastQuake","Can be set to notify you of earthquakes in your area, with location map and responses from others. You can enter your own info on whether and how strongly you felt event, with more text if you want. This is posted to the event for others.","5"
"29","LastQuake","Information always seems accurate. We have family all over the country and sometimes is other places in the world- appreciate the app.","5"
"30","LastQuake","I love the reassurance of immediately being able to tell if what you just felt was felt by others nearby.  One of those truly useful apps that really make your life easier and better.","5"
"31","LastQuake","I love this app!  I was in Ojai, Ca this month visiting a friend and felt like her log cabin home was moving n making cracking noises. She said that was common. immediately I received a notification that Ojai had just had an earthquake!! News didn’t have it that quickly!!  Thank you for this excellent app!!","5"
"32","LastQuake","I live in Alaska and how can we felt earthquakes that this app never mention. Earthquakes that shake my house very quick ones but when I visit that to check how grater was the earthquake I never find. I think if we felt the shake it’s because was on the 4 or 5s. Then I think this site needs to be improved. Thanks.","4"
"33","LastQuake","This app helps me know where the earthquakes are appearing and that leads to conversations with others on being ready with supplies and what we would do when ‘the big one’ hits my area.","5"
"34","LastQuake","My husband and  I were in the car when the earthquake hit ! He goes oh no ! We blew a tire .. I’m like I have felt this before .. it’s not a tire .. it’s an earthquake!! He says no I say yes.. well yes it was ! it was a 6.8 quake that really rocked us !! Love the app !","5"
"35","LastQuake","It was okay at firsr it worked fine but when it came to quack around 4.2 or something the app crushed. I cant load it and see where the location was eartquacke.","5"
"36","LastQuake","Is this app ever updated? On my phone, the “Significant”, “Near Me” and “All” bar is overlayed on useful text at the top on many screens.  I would also like to have an update on privacy policy. I am trying to figure out if I have an app that uses my phone shock sensor as a seismometer to report earthquakes to the cloud.","3"
"37","LastQuake","Been living in two earthquake prone countries for the last five years. This app has kept me up to date and when and how big the quakes were. Fastest app there is for updates on what’s happening around the world.","5"
"38","LastQuake","Simple to use, easy to read and understand. It’s all you need to find out the facts about where, when and how big an earthquake is.","5"
"39","LastQuake","9 times out of 10 my first earthquake reports comes from LastQuake before any of the other earthquake apps do. I really like how they show the region and the area and place dots next to all areas that take the time to post an I felt an earthquake","5"
"40","LastQuake","I love this app. I know local quakes before the news does. I love reading “real time” comments. I love the maps and I get more info than any new stations. Can track earthquakes real time all around the world.","5"
"41","LastQuake","This app keeps its users informed about significant earthquakes happening throughout the world. It warns of potential tsunamis and allows those who are directly affected by the tremors to share their feedback.","5"
"42","LastQuake","This is a very precise app. As soon as I feel an earthquake I go to this app and I I am able to give my input. I live in California so all I have lived with earthquakes my entire life. A must have for anyone tracking earthquakes.","5"
"43","LastQuake","Other apps do not come close to having all the functionality that you want right here","5"
"44","LastQuake","Just downloaded since my state is having quakes lately. This app reports them quickly and has a lot of data and a place to share comments with USGS and other users.","5"
"45","LastQuake","It's really nice to be able to see where earthquakes are on a map, get most of the associated info about them AND have the opportunity to report them.","5"
"46","LastQuake","Quake reports are visually easy to grasp, with more in-depth reports for those who click on them.  They also nicely take and make reports of quakes you feel and submit in your locality. Very responsible and well designed!","5"
"47","LastQuake","Quick, no nonsense, accurate reporting as accurate as the sensors could provide...I received earthquake notices from yesterday’s California earthquakes (July 4, 2019) as soon as it occurred well before anybody did, including the typical media outlets","5"
"48","LastQuake","Since most of my family lives on the Ring of Fire, this has been handy to keep track of activity. Accurate and it helps to read reviews from people who are in the zone","4"
"49","LastQuake","Lets me know when I don’t know. I didn’t feel it. I also appreciate the email about staying safe. I didn’t expect that and appreciate it a lot.","5"
"50","LastQuake","Best earthquake tracking and   mapping app I have seen. Could you add a layer to the map that shows the location (maybe even names) of major fault lines?","5"
"51","LastQuake","This app keeps u up to date with current earthquakes around the world. Jesus said his coming will be after these earthquakes happen in diverse places and they are .  . .","5"
"52","LastQuake","User friendly site and timely notification of earthquakes. Living in Southern California and having friends and relatives up and down the state I like to be informed of earthquake activity.","5"
"53","LastQuake","Being in Southern California, a little shimmying happens often. Sometimes as it’s still happening I get a report that comes through informing me of the location. Now I can’t blame the dog for scratching too vigorously.","5"
"54","LastQuake","Live in CA and often smaller earthquakes not reported on news. Now I know how frequent we have them, no matter how small. Another interesting component is the frequency, size and large span of locations. Learning my geography something I love!","5"
"55","LastQuake","Very interesting app. I live where not many quakes occur, so this is fascinating to me. I think when quakes are occurring, this app is updating to the minute. Kudos to the developer!","5"
"56","LastQuake","I check the site daily and let friends and family know too. I appreciate the service.","5"
"57","LastQuake","I have tried a few earthquake info apps and this is the best one I’ve tried. Easy to use, useful and reliable information.","5"
"58","LastQuake","Of the many apps I have tried, this app seems to be the most accurate and immediate in terms of notifications. Well done.","5"
"59","LastQuake","Great app, very helpful! If you felt something, you could check if it was a quake. You can also help the seismologists.","5"
"60","LastQuake","Would love to see more info like epicenter or exact location of where the quake was and not just “greater Los Angeles.”","5"
"61","LastQuake","I love that it has a “close to me” section and alerts so I am aware of quakes while at home and traveling. Being in California in the US means this is good to know info.","5"
"62","LastQuake","I really love this app! It’s super fast and accurate. No one wants to wait to find out how big the last earthquake was! I have told all of my friends and they love it too! A MUST HAVE app!","5"
"63","LastQuake","I would’ve rated it 5/5 but the abilitiy to upvote/downvote comments on the mobile app has apparently gone. It was definitely my favorite feature. Other than that, the app is just perfect.","4"
"64","LastQuake","Love this app !! It’s better then most of the apps out there . Abs the information is also updated quicker then the other apps.  I deleted my old app when. Friend told me about this one","5"
"65","LastQuake","This is a nice app but while I don’t particularly want to see every earthquake on the globe I certainly don’t want to see even magnitudes below 0.1. I can’t figure out a way to at least set it to only notify magnitude 5 or above. It’s ridiculous to see 1,2 & 3s - they are happening constantly and are of no consequence. Help please.","2"
"66","LastQuake","Love this app.. I live in Los Angeles, CA so it’s a important to have an earthquake app. I love this app because it notifies you right away after an earthquake unlike the County of LA app which sometimes has a long delay when an earthquake happens","5"
"67","LastQuake","I have enjoyed your quake reporting service immensely. We live in CA and my husband works out of town near major earthquake faults. This service gives me peace of mind that I can quickly get vital information about what is happening and where. Thank you. Rebecca","4"
"68","LastQuake","UI of the app is not easiest nor the fanciest. Does the work as expected. Watch integration is good but has double notification problem. Sometimes laggy response due to intense news update (could be 11pro max screen size problem).","4"
"69","LastQuake","I like the alerts of local quakes.  Easy to respond.  It took me a while to work out where to see shake-maps etc","5"
"70","LastQuake","True and scary at the same time... and it is reliable also with data. As you said it’s better if we wouldn’t have to use it, but what can we do... thanks for the great job!","5"
"71","LastQuake","Good interface. I enjoy reading the comments from others who felt the same quake and where they are located. I get my notifications quickly.","5"
"72","LastQuake","Like the app, alert and info given. However, kms from wherever makes location vague even seeing map. Miles too, would be nice but app is evidently metric only.","5"
"73","LastQuake","I like that as soon as I feel a quake, I can record it and then see where the quake actually happened. It's very accurate.","5"
"74","LastQuake","It is always up to date with many useful data from all earthquakes arround the world and really liked the notifications.","5"
"75","LastQuake","Definitely my go to quake tool. Living in California requires attention to the the Pacific rim of fire, as u never know where the next earthquake will happen. TSUNAMI are the worst for boaters","5"
"76","LastQuake","Good, solid, reliable, and free. I got it on recommendation for pastor Amir Tsarfati and I have not been disappointed. Best part is it’s all information I need with no fluff or junk.","5"
"77","LastQuake","It’s easy to read, reliable during earthquakes, and simple to contribute. It’s my go to earthquake app no matter where I am in the world.","5"
"78","LastQuake","When we have questions such as was Evan earthquake? Was it a truck? Do we need to evacuate? We get fast easy answers.","5"
"79","LastQuake","I like it's simplicity with the data. I'm not a scientist but I do like to know a little bit about everything. I felt my first earthquake ever using this.","5"
"80","LastQuake","I like this app. It is easy to use, you can set notifications for near or far earthquakes with the ability to add if you felt it.","5"
"81","LastQuake","I have many disaster type apps,some premium. But my family and friends are in high danger zones and this app is always spot on with info. Usually first to notify. Best response out there.","5"
"82","LastQuake","The developer actually writes back, which counts for a lot.  Interesting concept that prioritizes observations of people on the ground at the scene.  The user interface and description of the app could use some work.","4"
"83","LastQuake","Great application. Has the same features as the original web page, but very easy to use.","5"
"84","LastQuake","It takes a few minutes to let you know about the intensity of a tremor also I don't like that that that app does not tell you how far the tremor is from your actual location","4"
"85","LastQuake","I got this app after the July 4th CA earthquake for the sole purpose of notifying me of any local 3+. The notifications are not consistent. I will continue to use it for a few more days, in case the lack of notifications is just because of overload, but if it doesn’t get better, I will delete the app.","3"
"86","LastQuake","Great info, easy to use, updated promptly.  I like seeing comments of folks in my area.  Interesting to see how we all experience the same quake in different ways.","5"
"87","LastQuake","So far better than ShakeLA app. I think this is useful not just for the US but for otherworldly well locations around the world","5"
"88","LastQuake","I check it every day.  No one else around me knew we had one in our home state a couple of days ago.  I like keeping track.","5"
"89","LastQuake","Living as I do in Puerto Rico, where there are many earthquakes, having this app is invaluable. The information comes quickly and accurately and it’s important. Thank you!","5"
"90","LastQuake","I enjoy this app a lot easy to read exe.  But can you make the maps easer to read and load faster        Thank You!","5"
"91","LastQuake","Super helpful to stay up to date where all of the serious earthquakes are happening. Neat functions such as adding photos / comments!","5"
"92","LastQuake","Hey I love this application. It’s there for me when the PNWSN or USGS doesn’t report quakes, in certain areas. Most excellent all-around.  Gratitude for this application.","5"
"93","LastQuake","Living on a very active part of Northern California this app is quite useful.  I get timely and accurate information and am able report quakes that happen in my area.  If you have any interest in earth sciences get this app!0","4"
"94","LastQuake","I get notified of significant earthquakes near me minutes after the happen","5"
"95","LastQuake","Last Quake is kind of neat. You get to see where earthquakes are around the world in one convenient place.","5"
"96","LastQuake","I live on the Pacific coast a few miles from the ocean. I really appreciate knowing when earthquakes happen, where, and what depth.","5"
"97","LastQuake","I love having quick access to earthquake information. I also like the easiness with which I can report that I felt an earthquake.","5"
"98","LastQuake","This is an excellent incredibly useful tool for me, since my daughter and her family live in Southern California, which in my mind is very earthquake-prone.","5"
"99","LastQuake","I think that this a very informative application that I can count from in any time. Because I live in very seismic place in the southern part of the island 🏝 of Puerto Rico.","5"
"100","LastQuake","The EMSC folks use global seismographs to locate earthquakes, but they also get an even faster rough location from people using the app and reporting shaking.","5"
"101","LastQuake","Your app is excellent in getting information out. The facts of, where, when, how big of an earthquake are concise and knowledge of the impact to effected area. Keep up the good work.","5"
"102","LastQuake","Unfortunately this app labels Taiwan as a province of China. Many people mention this in the comments of the latest quake off the coast here but really the loudest voice is that of boycott and let them know why. The app pulled up the latest quake minutes faster than any other app which makes it even more disappointing. I will be deleting in solidarity.","1"
"103","LastQuake","I haven’t had any problems with the app and if you like knowing about this topic then it’s the app to have.","5"
"104","LastQuake","It’s the best earthquake tracking app I think. Really well made, free, user-friendly, detailed enough but not too much. Love it","5"
"105","LastQuake","It’s easy to tell the Earthquake levels since they are different colors.","5"
"106","LastQuake","Living in southern California, it's great to be able to check when earthquakes happen. It does exactly what it should.","5"
"107","LastQuake","Since the earthquake this year in Utah I’ve had a lot of anxiety! Being able to check locally is great!","5"
"108","LastQuake","I find knowing about all these earthquakes with this app very enjoyable. I imagine if an earthquake occurs near me this app will be very helpful.","5"
"109","LastQuake","The UI is glitchy, sometimes I get notifications and sometimes I don’t. However, still provides accurate EQ info.","3"
"110","LastQuake","This is a great app, seems to be close to real time although I can’t prove that since we don’t usually have earthquakes where I live","5"
"111","LastQuake","The app is my first place to get updates on any seismic activity I might feel or hear about. Always interesting to see how the waves travel & how people react to the events.","4"
"112","LastQuake","Really useful to get alert before it happened was able to tell people","5"
"113","LastQuake","Found this app while sitting in bed by self in a remote location. Was able to update me on the earthquake and resultant aftershocks I was experiencing. Gave me comfort. Love the local input","5"
"114","LastQuake","It reminds me regularly of the earth’s changes, other countries and local dangers.","5"
"115","LastQuake","It’s a great app I have a daughter that lives in San Francisco really worried about quakes in that area it keeps me up-to-date thank you","5"
"116","LastQuake","This app is awesome. Living in California I’m always curious as to whether or not what I just felt actually was an earthquake. This app does exactly that, and in real time. It is super helpful for my peace of mind!","5"
"117","LastQuake","Used this app side by side with a few others and this is definitely the best and on spot 🎯","5"
"118","LastQuake","Other apps break it down better by categories, but I love the comments section on this one","4"
"119","LastQuake","I’ve enjoyed the worldwide reports and have been especially glad for the more local reports on activity","5"
"120","LastQuake","This app is good only for fun, when earthquake hapenns in godforsaken islands in Pacific. Otherwise, this app is worthlrss as when quake actually hits and 3+ people try accesing it, it crashes or keeps endlesly fereshing. With all respect to non profit nature, people should really stay away from this, if you count fir acurate, timely or reliable info.","1"
"121","LastQuake","I have tried 2 other earthquake trackers and this one is by far the best.","5"
"122","LastQuake","Wish maps could be better. But this gives me a great view of the world.","4"
"123","LastQuake","Truly thankful for the service and all the realtime information they are providing to us users from Croatia.","5"
"124","LastQuake","Very simple and useful, crowd-based apps are usually precise and they are so fast in delivering news (faster than news networks/websites)","5"
"125","LastQuake","This app provides instant, clear information. It is my go to on earthquakes.","5"
"126","LastQuake","I love this app, very accurate info and maps and the alerts are always right on time.","5"
"127","LastQuake","I find this very interesting as to what and when they happen because we don’t hear about quake happening.","4"
"128","LastQuake","Very accurate and real-time alerts!","5"
"129","LastQuake","Please fix bugs on opening maps.","5"
"130","LastQuake","I was asked to review the last earth quake which I’m happy to. But I did not feel any earthquake so I am unable to rate it. This app keeps me updated but had no notice of one in my area, sorry.   Thanks","3"
"131","LastQuake","Good program for getting information about quakes locally or anywhere in the world.","5"
"132","LastQuake","I like that this app allows pictures, comments, and supplies a map.","5"
"133","LastQuake","Between many apps for alarming earthquakes by your location i think this app is better than.","4"
"134","LastQuake","Thank you. I like reading reports from people that felt eq.","5"
"135","LastQuake","LastQuake gives clear, concise information daily. So glad I got the app.","5"
"136","LastQuake","This app provides quick, vital information on location and scope of earthquakes. My “go to” app for earthquake information.","5"
"137","LastQuake","I can always rely on this site.","5"
"138","LastQuake","Easy to use, very accurate, shows quakes within minutes of the event.","5"
"139","LastQuake","So far accurate according to our local seismological activity center.","5"
"140","LastQuake","I appreciate the timely information. I live in an earthquake zone with a large volcano nearby. It is very helpful to stay on top of things.","4"
"141","LastQuake","Much better than USGS who are not always correct or hide quakes.  Thankful for this site.","5"
"142","LastQuake","Alerts quickly and helps prepare us in SoCal.  Just made it through a big one, 7.1, and the aftershocks, it was excellent","5"
"143","LastQuake","Does what it says it will do. Works well and user friendly.","5"
"144","LastQuake","Tells you when and where an earthquake happened around the world!","5"
"145","LastQuake","I live in SoCal and get notifications fairly quickly for all the quakes we have. I totally recommend this app","5"
"146","LastQuake","This app is pretty easy to use and responsive when an earthquake happens. It’s nice to have a a reference.","5"
"147","LastQuake","Alerts are great works better than most!","5"
"148","LastQuake","Thank you for keeping me on alert. It is very important to be prepared. My family and I thank you.","5"
"149","LastQuake","But the user Interface deserve some polishing. For example notification of earthquakes happen twice.","4"
"150","LastQuake","Not slow on reporting earthquakes. Appears to stand by their reports.  doesn’t downgrade as often as gsgs - that i have been able to ascertain.  Keep up the good work!","4"
"151","LastQuake","Awesome app, would like a little more geological data, but it’s still a great little app","5"
"152","LastQuake","Really quick alerts","5"
"153","LastQuake","I like the maps so I can visualize the location","5"
"154","LastQuake","Sometimes it is difficult to read the message on my iPhone.  Suggest: Either enlarge or bold more of the letters, for example - the place names.","4"
"155","LastQuake","Any news station ever will.  I love this app.","5"
"156","LastQuake","This app makes it easy to see the latest quake (I live in CA), and I like reading where and how intensely it was felt.","5"
"157","LastQuake","7 and later. And please update the app for major compatibility with iOS 15 and laterPlease add a support for Apple watch","4"
"158","LastQuake","Great for local information","5"
"159","LastQuake","Works really well. I was surprised how many we get in a day","5"
"160","LastQuake","Works very well and is informative. Setting choices are great as well.","5"
"161","LastQuake","I find this site informational and potentially a good warning system for upcoming quake activity.","5"
"162","LastQuake","This Application is Great, gives the observer the needed information, I like it very much.","5"
"163","LastQuake","Straight to the point. Nice to read other people's reactions and experiences to an otherwise traumatizing natural event.","5"
"164","LastQuake","I like the app no issues so far,will give it a higher rating after a month of using.","4"
"165","LastQuake","This app is very accurate and fast. I totally relied on the information.","5"
"166","LastQuake","You are ALOT more honest & accurate than USGS. My trust with them is thin and I’m glad that I can count on you all Thank you, Jill","5"

"174","LastQuake","Keeps up to date","5"
"175","LastQuake","Not my first earthquake app. I deleted this as it is not visual, not always accurate or consistent. Not a good look and feel. I used it about 10 minutes then the kicker was a 3.2 near Juneau AK. Description said Alaska, but map clearly shows the quake occurring in Canada.","2"
"176","LastQuake","It’s a great app for timely information & providing feedback!","5"
"177","LastQuake","Thank you guys for the good job you guys did by coming out with this app.","5"

"184","LastQuake","Most accurate info I can find earthquakes","5"

"196","LastQuake","Simple but informative. Easy to report when an earthquake is felt","5"

"199","LastQuake","For concerned global citizens this app notifies relatively and has other functions for users which is more than being without!!!!","4"

"206","LastQuake","I looked all over but I cant find where to get North America quakes only?","5"

"225","LastQuake","I like this app. It is easy to use and very informative.","5"
"226","LastQuake","This app seems to give good info on current quakes.","5"
"227","LastQuake","Receiving an alert 10 minute after the earthquake happens is not very helpful. But it’s a decent app otherwise.","2"

"243","LastQuake","The information about the Earthquakes are  so accurate. Love this app.","5"

"367","LastQuake","I'm super afraid of earthquakes and this feeds my paranoia perfectly. I love seeing where they are and how frequently they happen all around the world.   Criticism: I got a notification for a large earthquake off the coast of Mexico and no matter what I do there is no way to get the notification to go away. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the app. There is also no bug report buttons to let the developers know of the issue.","5"
"368","LastQuake","Living in an earthquake-prone zone such as Italy, this is truly a very useful app. And it is almost real time. Such a good idea. And the feedback mechanism is intuitive and simple. If only the responses could be translated into a common language...","5"
"369","LastQuake","I agree with the previous commenter. I, too, got the notification, and I have been waiting for the app to be updated and fixed, so that I don't have to look at the little BALL staring me in the face!! Well, I can't wait anymore for this app to be fixed, so I am deleting it!! When you finally DO fix it, send me a notice, somehow, and I will re-install it. To have to wait THIS long for the app to work properly is UNACCEPTABLE!!","1"

"425","LastQuake","Main EQ 2020-03-18 at 7:09 am in Magna UT the USGS reported it as 5.7. The app reports it as 5.6. There were 26 aftershocks as well. The app showed 6 of them. They were likely the more significant ones. I prefer accuracy over features.","4"
"426","LastQuake","I live on the edge of a huge fault line in Georgia that at present seems very stable with only a few shakes from the new Madrid faultline near St.Louis, Missouri. I am keeping my “eyes wide open”, for any and all earthquakes that I think may impact my area! I watch suspicious observers on YouTube everyday for updates on the planet! Great app!","5"
"427","LastQuake","I got this app in 2018 because sometimes I feel earthquakes that the local TV news or radio news doesn’t cover. It’s great to know the magnitude & epicenter almost instantly after I feel the earthquake. The only reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the “near me” filter never works, not even after the 6.5 magnitude 7/4/2019 SoCal earthquake.","4"
"428","LastQuake","But the GUI is not really easy to use and doesn’t feel like most apps on iOS so maybe this is a ported app from Android or something?  I think if you rethink your apps GUI: layout, controls and colors you will have a winner.  Too much red and controls are either too small or too big.  Honestly it feels like a web app.  Maybe take a look at other earthquake apps and adopt the best of each and make it your own.  Remember less is more.  Most people want to know of major earthquakes worldwide, any nearby that could have been felt, and to get notifications of those events and that then to be able to view the information of the events themselves.  Crazy bells and whistles and nonsense just bloat an app and lend to more possible bugs.  Thank you for you app and I look forward to seeing what you release in future updates.","2"

"430","LastQuake","This is wrong. This is in Oklahoma. I tried to find a place to report it but couldn't so here you go. When it's fixed I'll change my rating. Magnitude	MD 2.5 Region	SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI Date time	2017-10-09 13:54:48.2 UTC Location	36.54 N ; 89.62 W Depth	9 km","1"
"1","Alert SA","The previous emergency services app was so much better with options to select alerts for all emergency services agencies. This app is very basic with very little information available. Very disappointed when previous app was withdrawn and waited so long for a replacement which has turned out to be very disappointing. Bring back the original.","2"
"2","Alert SA","I used this APP during yesterday’s firestorm conditions and found it to be a very useful and informative tool.    A lot of people have been complaining about not being able to create watch zones and initially so was I.  I then watched my wife do it with ease on both an iPad and an iPhone and the simple step she made was to give it a name first, then the button “create watch zone” becomes active {goes black from the inactive grey}.  This was written in the instructions, first entry on creating watch zones. Mea culpa.  One problem I have which is more a nuisance than a bug is that when using an iPad and you work in landscape mode, the map remains in portrait mode ie it does not rotate as the iPad does. This means you have to turn the tablet into portrait mode to read it.   Otherwise a nice app that got us through the firestorm with confidence.  It is nice that you can add a 3D terrain or satellite imagery as your background.  The images are crisp, as are the 3D renderings of the terrain.  Well done team.  Peter Marsh","4"
"3","Alert SA","Useful app that has potential. Watch zones are good but need to be able to edit the size of each zone instead of deleting and doing it again. Also need to be able to select what type of alerts you want to be notified of outside of watch zones and have push notifications with an alarm sound (possibly a selection of sounds to choose from). Looking forward to the next update! 🙂👍","4"
"4","Alert SA","Dosent show areas of black that have been burnt like VicEmergancy app dose. Don’t always get notifications and when you do it’s really a bit late, friends had seen it on cfs Facebook 30min before this app let us know. It could of been to late. Other times it hasn’t let us know at all. Very very basic for a emergency app. It should clear the little fire pic once a fire is complete so that it’s gone and just leave a small black dot to show what area was burnt. And if a road is closed due to bushfire you shouldn’t have to go to a different app. People don’t have time to be swapping back and forth.","1"
"5","Alert SA","Not reliable, can’t set watch zones, doesn’t show up to date info re incidents.  CFS website or CFS via social media is much more accurate and in real time. I’ll keep on using the CFS data thanks. Govt of SA stated ‘the alert SA app has undergone extensive user acceptance testing to ensure it is reliable and able to withstand large volumes of users during peak periods’. Well that is not the case or else it would be reliable and functional. Don’t release an app until all bugs are fixed and it is user friendly. I’d give this a negative rating if I could.","1"
"6","Alert SA","This app is simple and basic but literally does exactly what I need it to do - notify me when there’s an incident/fire within my watch zone. I get the alert on my Apple Watch and then I can check it out and monitor it. Works a charm.","5"
"7","Alert SA","Basic functionality is working which is good but there are still basic issues that need addressing mainly around the colour schemes (when the phone is in dark mode):  * Most of the ongoing fires are shown as white circles with black flame icon - this looks like the fire is out * The text is dark on a dark background making it unreadable * Push notifications for watch zones seem to be very delayed. I am getting notifications which when I tap them takes me to the app which says the incident is no longer active  In its current state I find myself using the cfs website rather than the app. I am looking forward to some updates to fix the issues.","3"
"8","Alert SA","With fires in SA and temps over 40°C all week this app has been working well. Not as good as the previous version, which I had no problems with. I would appreciate adding a wind direction feature as this is important information in a bushfire situation. Also a heads up on road closures would be useful when evacuating.","4"
"9","Alert SA","Would appreciate options to toggle on/off notifications for burn offs as opposed to bush fires. I understand the premise but so many burn offs in spring and yet I don’t want to turn off notifications unless an incident that needs my attention crops up in a watch zone I follow. Thanks :)","4"
"10","Alert SA","There is no ability to set a geospace alert (watch zone) or select what type of alert you want to be notified about.  I don’t even know if you can get alerts.    Compared to the previously flawed version this is even worse.    After all this time is this really the best they could do? Even a simple pizza delivery company can do better than this and tell you where your pizza is.  I would have thought that in the an age of such advanced technology a government should be able to provide its citizens with an app that provides them with rapid accurate information that could protect their lives.  Someone needs to be held to account for this complete failure and maladministration of a vital public service. Mr Lander are you out there somewhere?","1"
"11","Alert SA","This a very basic notification app. It works, but provides limited information, not very well presented, and is a bit slow when things heat up. Can’t really see where the time was spent considering we waited so long for the relaunch.   I have gone back to using CFS website and “Fires SA” app. More information, more timely, easier to read.","2"
"12","Alert SA","After a couple of weeks with the new (?) app I have to say, in practice, it is no better than the old one. Would be helpful if alerts actually arrived. Returning to rely on the SAFires app. Very disappointed. [Thanks SA Gov for improving and returning with this app. Much needed in Adelaide and all SA.]","2"
"13","Alert SA","If I could give this app a negative rating, I would. A fire broke out 500 metres from my house. It was listed as a going grass fire on the CFS website with 9 appliances and 5 aircraft in attendance—and despite it being well within my Watch Zone I didn't receive a notification. We were alerted by helicopters and fire trucks going by the house and posts on volunteer-run FB groups. The mind boggles.","1"
"14","Alert SA","Used this for the Hills fires. The map showed one red symbol surrounded by scores of white symbols. This led me to believe that there was only one fire going, and the white symbols were contained fires. In actual fact, there were about 15 going; on the CFS site.   They said on the news: “AlertSA has been relaunched and won’t crash, such as in a prior emergency”. Ha, too bad the information is misleading.","1"
"15","Alert SA","The app works fine, but the colours on the menu etc are all the same as the text, so you can’t see anything until you tap it. But annoying - other than that it works fine!","3"
"16","Alert SA","Add to watch zone not functioning. When selecting confirm button takes you to location setting and yet unable to select the add to watch zone button.  Update, 13 Dec 2019. Now working as long as a name is added for the watch zone not just the address.","3"
"17","Alert SA","I love this app, being able to quickly see where everything is happening is amazing.  But, I discovered today that even though a fire was within my watch zone I didn’t get an alert/notification at all.  The app is called Alert SA yet can’t send me an alert??","1"
"18","Alert SA","Consistently NOT getting notifications of incidents in my alert area.  If you’ve going to have an app that is supposed to be in the interest of public safety, at least make it perform its most basic intended function!","1"
"19","Alert SA","Living in the fire ground of the Cudlee Creek Fire, this app was worse than useless. Compared to SA Fires app, it was always slow and unhelpful. Time is critical.  As it only gives ‘advice’ or higher warnings, it provides no warning for the on going spot and tree fires. Seriously, they are just as dangerous. I have now deleted the app as it provides nothing useful. SA Fires is my go to app.","1"
"20","Alert SA","It’s not reliably doing the most essential aspect of its role, that is sending notifications for watchlists I’ve created. Mostly I get no notification, sometimes they’ll come through a week later or when I open the app.","1"
"21","Alert SA","Last season I relied on Alert SA and it seemed to work perfectly. This year, I had no idea of a bushfire occurring 8 km away, no notifications, despite all the settings being correct.","2"
"22","Alert SA","Very easy to use and provides critical information in an emergency. Great to have this App back.","5"
"23","Alert SA","The old version years ago would alert you of incidents in your area but not anymore. There was major crash yesterday and no alert after hour of incident and we’re driving our usual route towards it.","1"
"24","Alert SA","The key design criterion for an emergency alert app is reliability- and this app fails to deliver. While working well on my iPhone for a year or so, alerts just stopped happening. Tried deleting and re-adding watch zones but with no success. Solution was to delete app and reinstall.","1"
"25","Alert SA","This is such an amazing app that alerts me if there are any fires near me! I highly recommend it! 10/10!  👍","5"
"26","Alert SA","I’ve had the app for several years and never received a single notification even though we have had several major fires within my notification zones. Only useful if you are checking the app constantly for fires yourself.","1"
"27","Alert SA","In dark mode the menu is invisible. Still works if you tap the black blank areas but you have no idea what you will get.","3"
"28","Alert SA","Unlike the similar NSW & Vic apps this one evidently shows the areas of fire warnings so gives no information about the actual location of fires. I would expect that to be the main feature users are looking for.","2"
"29","Alert SA","Thanks NSW for giving us “Fires Near Me” to power this app.  App needs option to select how early you are notified of bushfires.. immediately, incident alert time or incident warning time.","3"
"30","Alert SA","When this App is used in dark mode, it becomes back words in a black background. Seems pretty good otherwise 👍👍","3"
"31","Alert SA","I downloaded the app as soon as available as live in a high risk area. Set my zone and then a couple weeks later there is a fire 5kms from my house and of course I don’t receive any notification. What’s the use of setting a zone? Typically disappointing","1"
"32","Alert SA","Why do I need an alert when someone is burning off in the middle of winter. Pretty simple thing to fix, yet what do we get with new updates: better icons… great example of bloated government spending on useless infrastructure.","1"
"33","Alert SA","The only purpose of this app is to alert, yet notifications frequently stop working and the only way to restore them is to reinstall it","1"
"34","Alert SA","Can you please have a look at updating the colour of the menus? The dark blue is barely visible on the dark grey background (running the dark background on iPhone).","3"
"35","Alert SA","Its a year late. And one month into fire season and we finally get the app promised by SA govt   And the app doesn’t actually work It is supposed to Alert you when there is a fire close to you except it doesnt  They decided that minor fires dont need a notification. You only get a notification if the fire is  upgraded to an alert status.   The fire will show up in the app. But no push notification for it.   An Alert app that doesn’t actually send out an alert","1"
"36","Alert SA","Very basic.  Need to be able to tailor push notifications. I don’t want to get push notifications for every incident, only formal advice / watch and act / emergency warning.  Should also incorporate data from other agencies.","1"
"37","Alert SA","Just downloaded the app and text in menus and tabs are virtually illegible in dark mode. Noted that someone else reported the same issue a month ago!! Would be good to get on top of this sooner rather than later.","1"
"38","Alert SA","Please please please look at the VicEmergency app - purchase it from Vic if needs be and apply to SA. I live in SA but work for Victoria and the Victorian alerts are so much more helpful. Do it before lives are lost!","1"
"39","Alert SA","Fire 2 paddocks away from us today and no alerts were received via this app - this app seriously needs looking into.","1"
"40","Alert SA","Clear, easy to use and excellent to have for this bushfire season.","5"
"41","Alert SA","Can barely see anything when using dark mode. Deleted it immediately. Will use cfs website","2"
"42","Alert SA","For a government app it’s appalling that it is not up to date or current. I switched to the be informed app because it was more accurate.","1"

"1","Emergency Plus","Love this app and especially the addition of W3W. Would be awesome to have this as a widget to always show your location and also watch integration so you can have a complication on the Home Screen showing what three words locations for people hiking, exercising etc. easy way to get the information when you’re already on the phone is to raise your wrist.","4"
"2","Emergency Plus","I recently loaded this app onto the shortcut screen of our family phones (mainly for the kids) with the expectation that I would never end up using it.  This weekend, we had a fire in our garage where my husband was trapped and our garage door bolted closed, our home phone was out due to no power (thanks NBN) and I was trying to get my husband free. I called for the kids to evacuated and call emergency, with their shock they couldn’t find their phone so I grabbed mine.  Using this app took the frustration out of trying to find and open the phone app, get onto the call screen and dial emergency services. All I had to do was click the app, hit call then confirm - It was extremely responsive and I managed this one handed while trying to move furniture and unbolt a door. Fortunately all worked out well, emergency services arrived and everyone was safe.  A brilliant app.","5"
"3","Emergency Plus","I have used and promoted this since its inception as emergency +. I brought F&R NSW and Microsoft Australia together to port the application to the Windows phone store. I always thought the app could store GPS coordinates so if really remote you could take them to a location with coverage to give the exact to 000. It seems it does not but it should. At present I would need to take a photo and then get the coordinates from the EXIF metadata. A long way around and only IT nerds would think to do this. Can we please have a capability to store gps so we can then relay to 000 once back in service. Thank you.","5"
"4","Emergency Plus","On last Friday night I suffered a crashing stroke. I was out on the bathroom tiles and couldn't talk, thankfully my wife was right there. She was a little flustered (understandable) and could not remember the number to call. She had this app on her phone and switch straight to the app and called the emergency number directly, also read the home address straight from the app screen. I apologize if my words are mixed up, but I'm still recovering from the stroke. I owe my wife for her recognition of what was happening and straight through to the help needed.","5"
"5","Emergency Plus","I recently had a motorcycle accident on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. Knowing I had a broken leg I needed help ASAP. Calling 000 and using the Emergency Plus App my friends were able to guide Emergency services to our precise location. Within 60 minutes I was receiving the help I needed and was airlifted to the nearest Hospital. I'll never travel anywhere without the latest version of this app. Greater than Five Stars!","5"
"6","Emergency Plus","I had a serious fall mountain biking a couple of days ago. I managed to walk to the nearest fire road in a conservation area and gave my coordinates to the 000 operator. Our excellent ambo service had a 4WD in the park in good time, but took another hour and a half trying to track down which fire road I was on. I was in contact by phone but our maps were different. Eventually other riders spread out to guide them in. Would have been much better if they had something to plug my coordinates in and guide them to me on an up to date map.","3"
"7","Emergency Plus","* Valuable app which works well.   * No clear channel provided to give feedback to app developer team - 000 website ‘contact us for feedback’ page sends you off to a myriad of pages on Department of Home Affairs website :(  * Feedback on behalf of a visually impaired member of community: the location details may not be very easy for some people to see.  * Perhaps a future release possibly include an accessibility option whereby the user could press a button for the location details to be read out by the phone? [Google maps is able to read out directions even when the phone is on a call, so such a feature may be possible(?).]","5"
"8","Emergency Plus","Used this app in a remote National park in outback Qld when a group member collapsed. We got straight through and we’re able to clearly communicate our location in the park (not near any of the camp grounds or roads etc) to the paramedics. We had no coverage and the sat phone wouldn’t work but this app connected! Everyone who journeys in remote Oz should have this app.","5"
"9","Emergency Plus","Caution when reading out what 3 words over a phone to emergency services: their word list has similar sounding and pluralized words that may be misread by the operator and there are many examples of positions several km away with similar sounding names. There is security research on this topic. I would suggest incorporating other open source position readout protocols with better core technology.","4"
"10","Emergency Plus","I would like to see functionality for this app to send location coordinates as an SMS to a programmed list of contacts. This button should share space with the others on the main screen. Ideally an emergency SMS should be able to use any network available, but I’m not sure how that could be implemented.","4"
"11","Emergency Plus","This app would be a great deal more reliable and useful if you could store addresses, such as your home, work, etc. Perhaps you regularly visit a place where you feel vulnerable, such as car park, pedestrian tunnel, etc. If you could store those locations and easily select the right one, perhaps suggested by GPS proximity, when you accessed the app, then this app would serve its purpose much better.","2"
"12","Emergency Plus","I had to use the app recently with the bush fire crisis I live in a no mobile service area and land line was damaged due to the fires.  My husbands phone does not have mobile wifi so can’t use it to dial 000, and only works while the internet is up.  So downloaded the app thinking he can use it to dial 000 and found he couldn’t the app told him to use his phone to dial 112 and that didn’t work either - saying not available in the area. So he had to use Facebook messenger to phone me to ask me to call 000 I was 30km away. Don’t waste your time","1"
"13","Emergency Plus","This app is wonderful and surely has saved some lives.  Please change the app icon back to the old one though. The newer orange logo looks too much like other app icons and blends in. Not good for finding in a hurry.","5"
"14","Emergency Plus","I wish the app could give an on water lat/long we are having to convert the location given from this app to what we can use. Just the option to select the form would help. Otherwise it’s a good app","5"
"15","Emergency Plus","This app looks great. We were made aware of it in a first aid class. My instructor suggested that having a list of where the defibrillators are around you in the app would be really helpful, too. Maybe in the next update? Thanks!","5"
"16","Emergency Plus","The what3words integration is genius and is exactly what I’ve wanted when sometimes the apps location description is occasionally off or too vague. It will also absolutely be vital for those lost in bush land who make calls. An absolutely must have!!","5"
"17","Emergency Plus","Concept and execution is great.  However, I think it could be improved by adding the WhatThreeWords location in addition to the GPS coordinates.  In stressful situations, quoting three short words is often easier to articulate than a string of numbers.","5"
"18","Emergency Plus","Great concept guys. We are frequent interstate holiday drivers and have come upon not so nice truck drivers harassing motorists in certain parts between rural NSW and VIC. Knowing where I am exactly can help in reporting trucks or accidents! I will be recommending this to friends and family.","5"
"19","Emergency Plus","This is a great app. It would be even better if we were able to nominate it to not be archived to the cloud automatically if not used.. because you don’t need it, until you do!","5"
"20","Emergency Plus","I love the concept of the app and recommend it to friends, just hope I never have to use it. The GPS font size adjustment is great but I don't understand why you don't adjust the street address below it using the same setting.","5"
"21","Emergency Plus","The app was so helpful. It gives a perfect location every time. The app has heaps of great features but, the app looks a bit tacky and there are buttons that I don’t know what they do. There are also no instructions on what buttons do so please fix this!!! Overall I really like this app. Thanks!😝","4"
"22","Emergency Plus","Terrific idea but would be of limited value without my glasses. The words are very small. How about increasing the size of the three words to fill the screen after 10 seconds and also reading the words out to help people with vision impairment or illiterate.","4"
"23","Emergency Plus","The new app icon is much less ‘emergencyish’. I don’t like it at all. The old one stood out as a ‘click me now’ emergency button. The new one blends in. I’ll forget I’ve got it. In an emergency situation an app you can find super quickly is really important as you may not be thinking straight.  Otherwise I still like the app.","3"
"24","Emergency Plus","Great app. Is it possible for the app to have greater accessibility functionality to support individuals who may not be able to identify their location, understand the operator and/or see/say the 3 words.  Thank you","4"
"25","Emergency Plus","Great app :-) I would also like to see the Military Grid Reference System added with long / latitude.  Messaging option would also be a great feature to have also.","5"
"26","Emergency Plus","Today, I got caught up in a traffic accident in rural SE QLD and needed to call the emergency services but had no idea how to describe where I was.

"31","Emergency Plus","I thought that the What Three Words software gave a unique set of 3 words to reference a specific map location, but when I tested this on 2 mobile phones sitting next to each other, the latitude and longitude were the same but the three words were different. Is this meant to occur?","2"
"32","Emergency Plus","In my panic I tried to look for this app but swiped past it a good few times as it looked like a bunch of other apps I have. Maybe needs a redesign, like blue and white checkers, which is far more recognisable to the brain especially in panic mode?","3"
"33","Emergency Plus","Overall, it’s a great app, and will save lives. The emergency contacts are comprehensive, but could use mental health emergency contacts. This is of critical importance when responding to people who are psychotic or suicidal, and will not seek help on their own.","4"
"34","Emergency Plus","How can this be? It shows blue dot in correct place of my home, but the address named is a 3 minute walk away across a park.  I then entered into Google Maps the GPS coordinates listed in the app as being my location.

"36","Emergency Plus","Trying to teach my 3 yr old how to use it but he has to confirm to dial 000 3 times before it rings and then try to switch it to loudspeaker before he can hear it.  Would be excellent to have automatic dial and loudspeaker function with one touch from a locked phone. I understand risks with accidentally dial but it’s too hard for a 3 year old in current format?  Maybe where it asks “cancel” you can colour this red and “call 000” make this green! Remember kids can read it needs to be picture or colour based for them.   Can u pls fix!","2"

"113","Emergency Plus","As a former emergency responder, I think ‘Emergency Plus’ is a fantastic idea, and I especially like that the application can automatically display one’s exact location using multiple methods, with varying degrees of accuracy.  The application does need a fair bit of work however.  Firstly, there is “critical” information deep within the menu that many people would not know are even there… For example, to find the ‘CPR guides’ and ‘fire alerts’, one must click the three lines in the top-left corner, followed by clicking ‘More Information’ and then finally, the drop-down arrow next to either ‘Royal Life Saving’ or ‘Fire Alerts’.  This is way too many steps to access “critical” information during an emergency and to be honest, most people probably wouldn’t even realise that they could find “critical” information like this deep in the menu.  It would also be nice to see ‘Apple Watch’ support integrated.  Just about everybody has an Apple Watch these days and adding support for these products would not only allow callers to use ‘Emergency Plus’ independently (i.e. when their smartphone is not physically with them), but it would also make the process of talking to emergency personnel easier (e.g. callers can refer to their Apple Watch for location information without needing to drop their smartphone away from their ear). Things like fire alerts could also be delivered to one’s Apple Watch product in real-time, even if their smartphone is not physically with them at the time.  I also don’t understand why there is no support for ‘Amber Alerts’ whatsoever.  I rarely know when ‘Amber Alerts’ have been issued, because I don’t listen to commercial radio or watch commercial television, and I don’t use social media, so the only time I know there’s an ‘Amber Alert’ active is if I just happen to drive past one of the dynamic road signs (i.e. the LED road signs that change)… If this application supported ‘Amber Alerts’ or better yet, supported ‘Amber Alerts’ AND ‘Apple Watch’ products, I could be notified in real-time whenever an ‘Amber Alert’ is active.  Another important feature which is lacking is support for notifications and by integrating such functionality, ‘Emergency Plus’ could deliver real-time notifications for Amber Alerts or emergencies (accidents, natural disasters, severe storms etc…) to anybody in the affected area… As with other (third-party) applications, users could optionally permit their location to be shared in the background, to fine-tune the delivery of such notifications.  ‘Emergency Plus’ is an invaluable application to install on one’s smartphone, but it still has lots of rough edges and to be honest, it almost feels like a beta (“draft”) application… Whilst I’m sceptical, it would be nice to see this application updated to address these criticisms.","2"

"115","Emergency Plus","Just downloaded app & love that it has a street address shown on a map AND lat/long displayed PLUS degree of accuracy (within 65m for example). While 000 may ask for cross streets, these can be seen on the map in built up areas. And having lat/long is better than nothing in remote or rural areas, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe we need to upgrade our 000 responders so they have the ability to view lat/long on a map or vehicle GPS. Given the huge areas that don't have street addresses, lat/long is necessary at times.","5"
"116","Emergency Plus","I was showing my mother this app saying how it was a great idea. She thought so too but her feedback was that the coordinates were very small and difficult to read, especially if you were in an emergency situation and feeling dizzy etc. It looks like there is room to make the co-ordinates larger and perhaps black on white text would be easier to read especially for older people or if you're glasses have been lost/broken in an accident.

"117","Emergency Plus","The app info section says it was developed with valuable assistance of Vision Australia. Why then is the font so small and the GPS coordinates and address details so small?! In a stressful emergency, this info needs to be bigger. A previous review suggestion for the inclusion of the poison line and mental health emergency number numbers is a good idea. Overall though this app is a good. Having had to call 000 before on a remote road with no reference points, this app would have been very useful .","3"
"118","Emergency Plus","I had to call an ambulance for a life threatening emergency today. I was on an unfamiliar rural road and had so much trouble trying to explain my location. The guy almost died while the ambulance was delayed... I'm totally overjoyed to find this app as I can already see how essential it is... Should be compulsory for every motorist! Truly a great invention which will save lives!","5"
"119","Emergency Plus","This app seemed like a great idea - very clear layout with easy to read GPS co-ordinates.  Was about to load the app onto my mountain biking son's phone and noticed the current location was way off.  Clicked on the map and noticed a disclaimer - 'accurate to 6000m' which makes the usefulness of the app questionable especially situations such as mountain biking reserves or national parks etc.  6km is quite a distance. Can't understand this inaccuracy - hopefully it can be fixed.","3"
"120","Emergency Plus","Today I used this app for this first time! A car accident in the middle of nowhere, I was as able to use this app to call emergency services and provide my location within 30 minutes police arrived with ambulance and fire truck a few minutes later!  A must have app for everyone!","5"
"121","Emergency Plus","If the app could automatically share the app users GPS location with Emergency Services i.e. without the app users intervention, it would be 5 stars from me.  The app is a genius concept. I'm telling everyone I know about it. I have some friends from a non-English speaking background I'll be installing this app for them.","4"
"122","Emergency Plus","Great idea but GPS location coordinates on the home page are too small to read. Unless you have 20/20 vision it is too hard to see the location and numbers. Other reviews have said this too.  There is enough room on screen to increase the text size so why has this not been modified by the app developers? It is pretty crucial in an emergency to be able to read your GPS location.","2"
"123","Emergency Plus","If cross street, other emergency numbers like poisons, mental health and a spot for making notes of when u called were added then this would be 100% useful.  PLUS - where's a button for 112 when there's no mobile coverage? A total must.  Well done developers","4"
"124","Emergency Plus","I haven't had to use this, but it would be great if you needed to. It loads really quickly so you're not waiting just to make the call, the location, for me anyway, was perfect, and it's laid out in an easy to use way, with various numbers in case you don't know whom to call. :)","5"
"125","Emergency Plus","When in an emergency and needing to read out coordinates to the 000 operator, many older or visually impaired people might not be able to read them out due to the numbers being very small. A person may not have their glasses with them or be able to find them in this emergency. An improvement on this app would be to enlarge these coordinate numbers. Thank you.","3"
"126","Emergency Plus","This looks fantastic especially for isolated roads or beaches but I have a real concern that my young kids could accidentally ring emergency services if they play on my phone. Any chance of adding the option of using a password or something similar to access the app?","4"
"127","Emergency Plus","Loaded up and found my location (street address) perfectly. Could be very handy in a rural situation where accuracy using Lat / Long coordinates would be much better. Out of WiFi range will take GPS in phone longer to establish accuracy.","5"
"128","Emergency Plus","If there was an option to store your emergency info (like iEmergency) as well it would make it a very comprehensive app. And perhaps a source of information for emergency services if the patient was unresponsive on arrival. Please consider for next upgrade. I would happily pay to purchase.","4"
"129","Emergency Plus","Why does the app still use gps in background when you don't give it those privileges? Still indicates it's in use even when not in the app and when you kill the apps. Battery drain not the best thing when you are in an emergency...","4"
"130","Emergency Plus","Yeah! This is a gr8 app! But it's a pity that you can't just press a button to share your location with pre-programmed Emergency Services or others members of your family or friends! By SMS, Email or Social Media! In future software updates, could you PLEASE add this facility! Thank you!","4"
"131","Emergency Plus","This is brilliant, only thing that would make it better would be a share button to send link to to friends","5"
"132","Emergency Plus","I really like this app! A few updates would be great...  - address bigger - 112 as a common number. For mobiles out of area - a users profile that emergency workers can look up if required (name, dob, address, blood type, in case of emergency, etc)  - a other numbers section.","4"
"133","Emergency Plus","Maybe add a feature that you can just send the operation instead of reading it out. There should be a button that you can press and it'll just send your immediate location.","4"
"134","Emergency Plus","Should be included with the iOS automatically. Good to have all this info in one place with quick gps location. Recommended for everyone.","5"
"135","Emergency Plus","Whilst the concept of this app is excellent I can not seem to get it to work in airplane mode or without sim. Perhaps an update is needed so that pressing 000 will actually dial 112 which is the universal number that will contact 000 in Australia even if you do not have a SIM card in your phone","3"
"136","Emergency Plus","Simple to use and easy to understand. I recommend everyone has this on their phone. Haven't needed to make an emergency call yet but it looks easy enough for anyone to do.","5"
"137","Emergency Plus","Great app wish it would send GPS position and you could also take a picture incase you witness something. A Must have app thank you","5"
"138","Emergency Plus","Great app but it kept contacting emergency services while in my pocket. Felt bad for the staff there as I am sure they had better things to do. Great in an emergency not so great if you just want to throw your phone in your pocket and not create a major incident accidentally.","4"
"139","Emergency Plus","It doesn't happen often, but when I need to know which number to use for a situation I have found myself in, this app gives me the answers! Great job","5"
"140","Emergency Plus","Haven't had to use the App yet, but have loaded on to all our devices. Simple design & well laid out. Nice to see location displayed clearly, this often difficult to know when you are stressed or in an unfamiliar place.","4"
"141","Emergency Plus","Would be even better if one or two photos of the emergency could be sent to 000 at the same time - e.g. of the fire being reported.","4"
"142","Emergency Plus","When visiting a relative at their house, she had bad accident was drifting In & out of consciousness. I'm not smart, neither is my cousin, so as he called triple zero, I got out the app and checked the address to tell the operator. A Lifesaving app!","5"
"143","Emergency Plus","Downloaded to my iPhone,  hope I never have to use it but it picked up my location and street address in Qld immediately, also gave my GPS coordinates,  it was spot on.  Great app.","5"
"144","Emergency Plus","Found my location exactly, with & without wifi . I think it would be great for my kids when not at home. Thank you","5"
"145","Emergency Plus","Turned wifi on and the location was exact!","5"
"146","Emergency Plus","This is a LIFE SAVING app!!! I'm sure it has already saved lives! Everyone please rate this app so more people will hear about it! How many other apps save someone's life? Incredible!","5"
"147","Emergency Plus","An additional feature that could improve the app is a gps tracking system of emergency service vehicles travelling to the place of the accident/incident.","4"
"148","Emergency Plus","Great app, helps Emergency services find you a lot easier if you don't know where you are. Recommend it to all your friends","5"
"149","Emergency Plus","Great app but as stated by other users, the address has to be BIGGER! How can you tell the operator your current address or co-ordinates when not at home if they are too small to read? This app is still a must have.","4"
"150","Emergency Plus","Took them a long time to start thinking it should have been out as soon as GPS phone was invented.","5"
"151","Emergency Plus","Good app but needs a place to put the phone number of your own emergency contact person in case you can't tell responders","4"
"152","Emergency Plus","Great for adults and kids alike. Easy to use. Can save emergency operators valuable time by you knowing where you are","5"
"153","Emergency Plus","How is it possible in these modern times, that a victim must double tap to return to this app for GPS co-ordinates (which are available on the included iOS Compass app anyway) in order to VERBALLY state their location??  Good suggestions in other reviews, but with a positive 4 star rating, I doubt those ideas will be implemented.","2"
"154","Emergency Plus","Awesome not only does it have all the emergency numbers in one place also tells you were you are..great idea.","5"
"155","Emergency Plus","It'd be good if it actually had my location correct instead of 20km away and not giving me the closest address I'm afraid that's not going to be much good the ambos if they can't find me or is it just accurate for NSW and not any other state ??? Definetly needs some updating done on it before I consider it useable","2"
"156","Emergency Plus","Works well and could easily save lives directing emergency services to the correct location.","5"
"157","Emergency Plus","Read about this app today and had to get it. It is a great idea. I hope I never have to use it but glad I have it just incase","5"
"158","Emergency Plus","I hope I don't use it but it would certainly help me if I needed. It's on my home page ready to go.","5"
"159","Emergency Plus","I tested the GPS coordinates and it placed me only 10m from my home. It feels very reassuring to have access to a potentially life saving app","5"
"160","Emergency Plus","I have used this app when I got a flat tire on my car. I could tell the RAA where I was which is helpful.","5"
"161","Emergency Plus","The non urgent police line isn't a national service as is health direct. The app should be state specific depending on the location identified by the app. Eg Nurse on Call in Victoria or the local police station number.","4"
"162","Emergency Plus","This app should come standard on all iPhones in Australia. Quite possibly the handiest app to have.","5"
"163","Emergency Plus","This app has the potential to save many lives. I highly recommend it.","5"
"164","Emergency Plus","Tried it to see if it would work and picked up my location straight away!!!!","4"
"165","Emergency Plus","Just downloaded this app because I thought it would be very handy in giving your exact location in an emergency, only to find my location was out by 3+kms which is concerning.","2"
"166","Emergency Plus","We are the ones that brought this concept to the emergency sector and government after Years of Meetings and emails,plane trips, selling our idea and procedure trying to get this concept through to 000. But instead they stole our time took our ideas and go ahead release there own!","1"
"167","Emergency Plus","Great to see an app that truly is a serious emergency necessity and lifesaver should one need it, hopefully never; but it's there just in case👍🏼  Brilliant, Great & Terrific 🎉","5"
"168","Emergency Plus","Just downloaded this app so I was just checking it out at home and the map location is so wrong that it would cost someone their life.  I mean, not just a couple of houses out, like a totally different road about 9 or 10 kilometres away !!!! Just so wrong!","1"
"169","Emergency Plus","Love this app! It knows where you are even when you don't.","5"
"170","Emergency Plus","Stopped at an accident near Gembrook today. Used this app and despite telling the emergency phone operator the GPS coordinates, this did not help the operator to work out where we were. After a long conversation describing local landmarks the ambulance was finally dispatched. Disappointed.","1"
"171","Emergency Plus","App reports that I am on a particular road when I am in fact not. When I check on other services it shows my correct location. Would be dangerous if I reported the Emergecy plus location to 000.","1"
"172","Emergency Plus","Great app. But there should be a way in order to share and track location with 000 operator? As in find iPhone type feature.","3"
"173","Emergency Plus","Long time coming... Idea is old!!! Good to have but may use once in a while.","5"
"174","Emergency Plus","App has everything, this app is so valuable it could save Someone's life if not your own! Well done Fire and Rescue NSW! :D","5"
"175","Emergency Plus","Battery drain on both iPad and Samsung very high could render useless in emergency this is due to gps  always on locating coordinates I guess","4"
"176","Emergency Plus","What an awesome App... I have only just downloaded it. But the fact it uses GPS is fantastic.... Well done to those involved..... 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍","5"
"177","Emergency Plus","Excellent App but in a future update can you please include the nearest cross street, it's distance and direction? I usually get asked for that before GPS co-ordinates.","4"
"178","Emergency Plus","Found my location in an instant. Very accurate and precise.","5"
"179","Emergency Plus","Great app but needs locations of public access defibrillators on a map and maybe a metronome 100bpm","5"
"180","Emergency Plus","Good app, something that should been round long before now.","5"
"181","Emergency Plus","Please add the number for the 24hour statewide Mental Health Line and the 24hr Poisons Information Centre. Then it will be 5 stars!!!!","4"
"182","Emergency Plus","It's a must have must use. This app could save your life people! Use it!!","5"
"183","Emergency Plus","Funny... this app is strangely similar to the 'Call 000' app released months before - providing a Lat and Long and the ability to dial direct to 000 from the app itself. Works ok.","3"
"184","Emergency Plus","Location is spot on.  Great idea.?","5"
"185","Emergency Plus","I've just added the app on my iPhone and the location is not where I am, problem?","2"
"186","Emergency Plus","Should be included as a default app.","5"
"187","Emergency Plus","I'm at a street address 200m from a station yet the app located me as being in an underground tunnel. I want precision in locality identification before I can confidently recommend use of this app to several hundred in my workplace.","1"
"188","Emergency Plus","The gps coordinates are no where close to my address. Think you need to address this issue","2"
"189","Emergency Plus","Every Aussie should have this on their smart phone! Great app!","5"
"190","Emergency Plus","Lucky I have never needed to use this - location is way off!!","2"
"191","Emergency Plus","Off by a house which could be a problem","2"
"192","Emergency Plus","The idea is old but would probably use it once. It's good incase of an emergency.","3"
"193","Emergency Plus","Just downloaded the ap. I'm at home in a rural area. If I called emergency services and gave the location they named they would be sent to the middle of a farmers paddock 2km away.","1"
"194","Emergency Plus","Street is correct house number is wrong rural area","3"
"195","Emergency Plus","Tip top app, recommended at a tip top chat from a tip top bloke","5"
"196","Emergency Plus","Brilliant!","5"
"197","Emergency Plus","This app is very inaccurate regarding location. For my address it's 4 kms out. Dangerous. Can it be fixed please to be correct.","1"
"198","Emergency Plus","Excellent idea and we'll implemented.","5"
"199","Emergency Plus","The recent update causes the app to crash","1"
"200","Emergency Plus","The update freezes and nothing happens.😩😩😩","1"
"201","Emergency Plus","Recently speaking with a 000 operator friend about the App and the biggest issue they said is that the current 000 dispatch system apparently requires a street and nearest cross street for a dispatch. Like gps-coordinates.net the App needs to convert into an address and give nearest cross street or intersection! E.g. Display Great Eastern Highway, 300m North of Evans Street or Willy Rd, 200m South of High St.  Most people attending an emergency aren't near home and haven't any idea of where or what the name of the nearest cross street is.  I know cause I had the same issue in the Blue Mountains once. Or make it that the 000 operator can gain a street address from the displayed Lat/Long and work out a cross street themselves.","3"
"202","Emergency Plus","App puts address as 3 kms from where I actually am.","1"
"203","Emergency Plus","This is a life saving app. Well done....","5"
"204","Emergency Plus","Where can I find out the price of this app?","1"
"205","Emergency Plus","Recommended by the legend himself Paul Dillon","5"
"206","Emergency Plus","Excellent","5"
"207","Emergency Plus","A great app except for the way that position is indicated. Decimal coordinates DO NOT NEED the words latitude and longitude, they are easier to read and copy expressed like this:  -25.3442030, 131.0328650 (Uluru)  The coordinates cannot be copied easily into other apps by click and paste.  What Three Words is totally unnecessary when coordinates are free and can be copied off several apps, including Google Maps.","2"
"208","Emergency Plus","App is frequently advertised by emergency services, however it has not been updated for 2 years and references the now non-existent ‘home button’ in the instructions. It also does not fit on the screen for an iPhone X and up (XR, XS, 11, etc).    The phone numbers listed are also not in the recognised standard format, as per the ACMA Telco Numbering guidelines, which causes confusion. Ie: ‘13-2500’ is listed when it should be ‘132 500’.   Lastly, GPS locations are not necessarily accurate as it uses A-GPS when inside (not GPS), which places me several hundred metres (and in the wrong address) to where I am actually located. Further, coords are presented in decimal degrees only. This is not compatible with all emergency service CAD systems, and should also be presented in decimal minutes and also UTM.  This app could be helpful, however in its current for it either needs to be updated or advertising by emergency services needs to cease.","2"
"209","Emergency Plus","Great app.  Another useful emergency contact number might be the Poisons Information Centre No. 13 11 26. Could be useful for sea-life/bush/home related emergencies....","5"
"210","Emergency Plus","Emergency+ lift your game, when I put my phone next to my partners he is accurate to 10 metres? But I am almost 14 and a half kilometres away! Emergency services would never find me.","1"
"211","Emergency Plus","Location gets worse every time I turn it on. Currently accurate to 45252 metres, which is about how far wrong it is. Cannot recommend anyone should use this app.","2"
"1","VIC Fires","The Fire Ratings Forecast portion of this App has been fantastic, not only giving the forecast fire danger rating for each region but also a number for each rating , indicating the severity of each rating.  But unfortunately this has just disappeared, when you open the Fire Ratings Forecast from the menu the screen is blank. This has been the case for nearly 2 weeks. I’m a CFA volunteer and use this part of the App on a daily basis this time of the year. Hope it’s up and running soon?","5"
"2","VIC Fires","Thank goodness that this app is easy to use.  The ability to provide reliable and clear information about ‘events’ which doesn’t need to reset to consistently when exiting from an incident information link, unlike the ‘State’s Emergency Service’ app.  Please keep this app running as it’s fantastic.","5"
"3","VIC Fires","Needs explanation of what the different coloured shaded patches are.  They aren’t mentioned on the legend.  Probably it’s more obvious when there are not so very many fires. As far as I can work out, the “i” icons are each related to a shaded area but it is hard to work out which “i” goes with which patch. I initially thought the yellow patch stretching all the way up to Albury depicted the borders of a massive fire, but my relatives in the area assure me they aren’t burning, so I assume it goes with the air quality warning icon?  It wouldn’t hurt to have a Help page for new users to explain the basics of how to read the map.","4"
"4","VIC Fires","I currently have to watch fires on both sides of the NSW/Vic border and I’m using the RFS Fires Near Me app, this app and Vic Emergency app. RFS Fires Near Me is so much better that I use it to check the Vic side fires. It doesn’t give much info just fire boundaries (it’s not their role, they have enough to do) but it’s so much more user friendly than this app and the VE one. And typically the Vic based ones don’t lower themselves to include fires on the NSW side. Cut all the pretty animations and put an address function on it for starters. Then go check out Fires Near Me and change your design. We’re going to rely on these every summer from now on, please do better.","1"
"5","VIC Fires","All the information you need, in a fast reliable app. Far superior to fireready and vicemergency.  If you want a fire app that loads well with a poor mobile signal ( typical in hilly high fire danger country), includes fire info., wind (essential), even fire hotspot info., is simple to use (I have found this critical when there are fires nearby, because you start getting stressed and have many fast decisions and actions to take), does alerts, sorting, filtering, etc., nothing beats this.  I'd be happy to pay serious money for this app because I continue to depend on it.   The Government apps have been more than disappointing.","5"
"6","VIC Fires","Easy to navigate  clear quick and reliable information  So fantastic that it has wind speeds and wind direction  from weather stations across the state  I don’t even bother with the other fire ready app hard to navigate and not user friendly this one’s excellent","5"
"7","VIC Fires","Recurved a quick response on how to select your choice of watch zones from the developers which was pleasing.  To select your own individual watch zone, go to the map and zoom in on the location you wish to watch.  Hold your finger on that spot and it will come up in the watch zone add screen.  Select Add and your done.  You can select multiple watch zones","4"
"8","VIC Fires","As a emergent responder this used to be a a 5 star app especially for fires ect. But they recently changed their data feed and now it is notification overload.   My watch zone is only 15km and I get notified times every time a tree falls down and often multiple times for the one incident. After 100s It’s to the point I don’t even take notice. They need to filter the notifications or allow the end user the ability.","3"
"9","VIC Fires","I used this app before Vic Emergency was created. It was excellent. It is still good although Vic emergency seems to have taken the map feature which I liked. It would be good if the app could include when local fire restrictions are in place and when they are lifted, maybe by using postcodes. Could also be good if we could use the app to report intended burning off on a property. We currently do this via phoning.","3"
"10","VIC Fires","VicFires gives me a large amount of information in useable format. I can see what is happening around the state while restricting my notifications to just my watch zone.  As a plus I also found the support to be quick and friendly.","5"
"11","VIC Fires","I’ve been using this app for years. It’s very user friendly, and provides all the information I need to be aware of the fire situation in my area. However, it does not update as quickly as it used to, and does not show fires nearest to me any more. It used to open at the nearest fire, it now shows me fires many miles away, even if I have a fire close by. I used to recommend this app to everyone, but cannot any more.  A shame.","2"
"12","VIC Fires","The app is quite good, however, the ‘watch zone’ function does not work (it will delete the watch zone you enter off its list within minutes. Additionally, you cannot search for a location by entering an address, you have to search for a location in the map which is cumbersome).","4"
"13","VIC Fires","Being able to quickly find out where nearest bushfires are gives relative peace of mind.  This informative app provides all the data required to know when to stay, or go, and in the safest direction.","5"
"14","VIC Fires","This App. is very informative and up to date. Allowing you to set  perimeters for your own area will hopefully give you time to leave if the need arises. Would recommend this to residents who live close to the city but amongst open forest areas.","5"
"15","VIC Fires","I really appreciated how very up-to-date the app is with fire information!  the other day when I was driving on back roads in country victoria. I saw smoke and checked the app, and realised I was heading straight for a quickly growing new grass fire.","5"
"16","VIC Fires","I have set my watchzone up to include Bribie Island, Caboolture etc .. currently there are couple of fires on Bribie but nothing is showing on the map, yet on mainland its working.. is Bribie excluded from map markings and incident listings or something ?","5"
"17","VIC Fires","I only want to know of fires in the area I choose. I don’t want to see all the fires in the state mainly being in the Melbourne area. They fill up my page and I just don’t want to know about them.","5"
"18","VIC Fires","I don’t like the new fire danger rating- it doesn’t specifically state TFB says, and I can’t seem to find what the rating figure actually signifies 🤷‍♀️ We live and work in an area and industry ( agriculture) that is heavily impacted by extreme weather conditions and the ‘old’ way was an extra tool to use.","3"
"19","VIC Fires","used to be able to click the town weather icon and then click to get a history of the wind or temp now it just causes the app to crash. Makes the app less useful when trying to track wind changes in fire season","2"
"20","VIC Fires","I am a country user & in bush fire zone.  I find the app freezes, cant scroll through the warnings, have a number of messages or whatever notified on app icon but can’t seem to find what they pertain to as no matter what screen I tap on the no. doesn’t decrease.  Feel a bit duped of my $. Just isn’t user friendly or work as I expected.","2"
"21","VIC Fires","Recently this app won’t open or crashes. Suggest maybe an update is required?","5"
"22","VIC Fires","Love the app.  Especially how you can view the map as a satellite image. This gives you by far a better idea as to where the fire is and potentially how devastating it can be.","5"
"23","VIC Fires","I think this app is one of the best Fire and Emergency app I’ve ever used. Not bagging out EmergencyAUS or EmergencyVIC but this app is way better then those 2. Its very accurate and has more detail then the other ones do. Great App !","5"
"24","VIC Fires","Great app - I was able to see what fires are around, how far away, and how serious. It also shows other warning like trees down and thunderstorm/asthma alert. Thanks so much","5"
"25","VIC Fires","Would be great if we could see the fire indicator panel alarms again in this app","5"
"26","VIC Fires","As a travelling musician, with friends all over the state, I call this app my peace of mind in the fire season. Thanks for keeping it so up to date and easy to use!!!","5"
"27","VIC Fires","It’s a relief to have this app, thank u to all the people that update the information & are involved with this app. The information is so well presented & accessible.","5"
"28","VIC Fires","I like the app loads instantly and gives me accurate up to date info. I live in Wonga Park so I’m watching and listening to it till end of March these days. Thankyou","5"
"29","VIC Fires","Quick notifications & very easy to understand & read. Have recommended to many people👍","5"
"30","VIC Fires","Great app but needs to be updated more often, right now we have a fire next to our property and last update was three hours ago. Obviously commonsense takes precedence but it’s good to have the best advice !","3"
"31","VIC Fires","Works well, very handy and a safety net. Only one complaint, there is a yellow skin all over victoria and makes it hard to see under it.","5"
"32","VIC Fires","Great app! Clear, easy to understand and very informative! It’s great seeing how many trucks are sent and then the classification of safe/ responding/ under control is great!!","5"
"33","VIC Fires","I use this app constantly living in a fire prone area. The information is vital to my decision to leave during high fire danger days","5"
"34","VIC Fires","I find Vic Fire App very informative with up to date details on fires. As l live close to bush land l find this info critical and either puts my mind at rest or l have to action our fire plan 🔥","5"
"35","VIC Fires","It’s a great app when traveling around Victoria through the bush to let you know if it’s safe","5"
"36","VIC Fires","Great app. Far better than the vic emergency app, quicker with up dates and much more informative. Well done","5"
"37","VIC Fires","A great app keeps me on the know of all the fires for I have family in the country so it also gives me a piece of mind.","5"
"38","VIC Fires","Whats the point? Had what we thought was a fire within 1.6k’s from home according to the map on Vicfires when the fire was 10-15k’s away. Really! Oh and there has been a fire at Goldie Spur track for weeks yet its never been shown on the map. Whats the point!","2"
"39","VIC Fires","Great asset too fire agency pilots opening OzRunways hopefully will see the other states added soon","5"
"40","VIC Fires","This app is too busy and no key/legend readily available to explain what you are seeing. The flame symbols are cute but after a while they get very distracting and cover too much area on the map. It is hard to see simply where the fire has burnt!!","2"
"41","VIC Fires","I can see what’s happening locally, and get notifications of anything nearby.","5"
"42","VIC Fires","Excellent app.  Great for keeping up to date on local incidents, especially on high fire danger days.","5"
"43","VIC Fires","Great app. I use it all the time. Keeps me up to date and you need that in a fire zone. Keep up the good work. David.","5"
"44","VIC Fires","It’s great sometime fires look closer than they are Ie today’s burn off at Briag along looked close from Munro website reassured me that it was a Burnoff","5"
"45","VIC Fires","Have been using this App for a number of years and it is awesome. Very accurate and informative.","5"
"46","VIC Fires","It would have to be one of the best apps ever. For safety and security where any fires are at any given time. Thank you. Ron","5"
"47","VIC Fires","Very useful. Especially on very risky days. Lots of info and very good rain radar.","5"
"48","VIC Fires","I live in the city but I have a small country farm. All I want to see is any fires within a 10k radius of the farm, which is what I have the watch zone set to, not everything!","3"
"49","VIC Fires","Not worth the $1.50. Doesn’t provide information any better than the free VIC Emergency app.   A very poor feature is that you can only set a Watch Zone for the location you are in. You can’t set zones for where friends and family are.","1"
"50","VIC Fires","Great to have to keep updated with fires locally and for when traveling countryside","5"
"51","VIC Fires","Brilliant/ easy to use. My life line over summer during fire season in Gippsland","5"
"52","VIC Fires","The app is getting better all the time.","5"
"53","VIC Fires","Love this app it keep us in check what is happening in my area","5"
"54","VIC Fires","A great app keeping us up date on fires in my area. Keeping the communities safe.","5"
"55","VIC Fires","Need a map to show where the fires are","5"
"56","VIC Fires","As I live in a bush fire prone area, this app keeps me informed. It is up to date and easily navigated","5"
"57","VIC Fires","So much better than NSW - congratulations on a top job - thank you","5"
"58","VIC Fires","This app certainly keeps up to date with emergency situations. Living in semi rural areas, it shows me where fires are","4"
"59","VIC Fires","Identification of active fire points is useful for the public when fire starts and when it is spreading.  Active points on large fires are most relevant to the public when located on the perimeter of the area already burnt. See NSW fires near me.","1"
"60","VIC Fires","The updates on this are terrible, despite having it set up to update every couple of minutes it hasn’t updated in 5 days!","1"
"61","VIC Fires","Love this app keeps me full up to date worth every penny !😀😀😀😀","5"
"62","VIC Fires","Updated info, for fires. Needed for hills people.","5"
"63","VIC Fires","Too little information and map features. Live Wind direction and speed would be a great feature. More information about the actual fire. Poor app","1"
"64","VIC Fires","Very disappointed with this app as any new or current fires aren’t allocated the fire regions looks very jumbled and difficult to find a fire in your area","2"
"65","VIC Fires","Hopeless. Cannot get wind directions. Cannot change it to only give my home setting area.  Settings don’t alter when changed.","1"
"66","VIC Fires","Use this app every summer it is very reliable","5"
"67","VIC Fires","Such a relief to have this app.  Thank you so much.","5"
"68","VIC Fires","The map doesn’t show where the actual fire edge is like the nsw version does. When it comes to showing you where the fire is, it’s pretty useless.","1"
"69","VIC Fires","Why do you use the Swiss flag for emergencies instead of a Red Cross! A common error!","5"
"70","VIC Fires","Gives me a lot of peace of mind living in the Victorian countryside.","5"
"71","VIC Fires","Very fast","5"
"72","VIC Fires","Not accurate  Updates of serious fires very poor To many small irrelevant incidents Maps too general","2"
"73","VIC Fires","East Gippsland currently has several bushfires burning but some site info hasn’t been updated for 3 days","1"
"74","VIC Fires","Need a map of where fire is not where it may be effected . Include types of vehicles  How many helicopters planes etc Where evacuation centres are etc","2"
"75","VIC Fires","Used to work fine but now all I get is a black screen  ...  .. and yes, it's connected to the net, no blockers, etc. Still works on my iPhone though.","1"
"76","VIC Fires","Thought it might be better than the new Vic gov one, can’t get it to set up a watch zone for anywhere other than where I am now?","1"
"77","VIC Fires","Never been on here prior don’t know why they’re on here now. They’re hardly ever an emergency.   Also you need to update for FRV","2"
"78","VIC Fires","Great to be kept updated !","5"
"79","VIC Fires","Can you add the trucks to the job too please","4"
"80","VIC Fires","Copy’s off the free app 100 notifications for stuff outside watch zone even with notifications edited and shows what I need 10mins after the free app waste of $$","1"
"81","VIC Fires","So much better than VIC emergency","5"
"82","VIC Fires","1- Pls adjust app so i stop getting alerts from outside my set watch area 2- Stop calling every tiny fire a 'Bushfire'. It will eventually make everyone immune to the term!!!!","1"
"83","VIC Fires","A lifesaving app","5"
"84","VIC Fires","When concerned about a fire we require more frequent updates","1"
"85","VIC Fires","Updates need to be more timely and informative.","2"
"86","VIC Fires","Would like more. They don’t seem to come up on my phone.","1"
"87","VIC Fires","I think VIC Fires needs to look how the TAS and NSW fires apps look.  VIC fires app is confusing as to what has been burned.","2"
"88","VIC Fires","Don’t bother.","1"
"89","VIC Fires","Not happy with whatis happening with the Blackwood fires no info!","4"
"90","VIC Fires","Even though the fire season in Victoria has been brief, I still found this App extremely useful.   Just wondering on some improvements:  1.	The badgeing that comes up seems to be for the number of incidents and there does not appear to be any way to cancel the incident i.e. once you have read it for example, and thus make the badgering a more proactive indicator as to something happening.   Could you make it possible to adjust badge setting or remove the badgeing altogether i.e. Badge Shows – All Fires, Going Fires, New Fires (those not cancelled by having been read), OFF. 2.	Would it be possible, using the GPS function of the iPhone, to be able to set a radius of current location for notifications? 3.	 A number of App have an alerting facility using a notifications onto the main screen (PUSH notification functionality) with a visual message and sound on receipt of some information i.e. Weather Warnings on Pkt Weather. It would be good if you could incorporate such a facility into your App so that you get a notification when details are received.  Again it would be good if it was selective and could also be turned off as per the badgering suggestion.  Thanks for what you have provided so far.","5"
"91","VIC Fires","Does not update enough","2"
"92","VIC Fires","Why does my Vic fires app not working?  Frustrating","1"
"93","VIC Fires","Great app very useful .....👍","4"
"94","VIC Fires","Really simple app but effective. If you could add some live CFA streams that would make this app even better.  As others have suggested, notifications on incidents would be great! As it's too difficult to find each users location when the app isn't open, the user could instead tell the app what incidents to be notified of depending on region or a radius of a selected spot.","5"
"95","VIC Fires","This is one of the most useful Apps I have come across. I know that the glitch with the home button whilst using Apple Maps is being fixed but in the meantime, select Google Maps and all works fine. I am impressed with the new features and congratulate the team behind the App for a quick working, accurate source of important information.","5"
"96","VIC Fires","App is great, until you need support. They ignore your request.  Upgraded my phone and this app didn't sync across to my new phone.  Why purchase something I have already paid for. They can go jump! I'll find another app instead just out of principle.","5"
"97","VIC Fires","Good little app but would be significantly improved if you could set your region and fire ban district.  One of the big problems with the CFA website is the fact that you see ALL incidents, and this little application mirrors that.  No PUSH notification functionality, no way of limiting or grouping important fires (like wildfire!).  It is a 'nicer' interface than the CFA website, but they could have gone so much further.  Still, worth the money.","3"
"98","VIC Fires","As you can see below, my first experience was very frustrating. Today the app worked - I have no idea why it worked today but not yesterday!  Now that I can actually launch it, I can attest that the app has a clean interface and is easy to read. The info is up to date and I recommend the app.  ******* I'm using a 32GB 3GS. I've tried clearing memory with MemoryInfo (more than 140MB free), I've tried rebooting my iPhone, I've tried using only NextG, I've tried using only WiFi and tried with both running simultaneously. I can't get this app to launch! I get the splash screen for approx 1-2 seconds and it quits. A competing app will launch so I know the CFA feed is OK. Very disappointed.","4"
"99","VIC Fires","There is a problem, the app says i have 24 notifications waiting in the app, and when i click on app, there may be one or two in there, i do delete them and the number just continues to grow even when nothing is there to report !!!! Plus there should be an option where u can choose only certain areas come up, or just grass fires or district.... I am a CFA member and i would like to know just whats in my district or town or area of towns......","3"
"100","VIC Fires","This app is great. I spend a fair amount of my spare time out bush and it is great to have this on hand to be able to check the status of nearby fire activity when I don't have my computer in front of me - i don't want to get sizzled!","5"
"101","VIC Fires","Great app, But like others have said it would be great to have a clear button so you know what ones you hve looked at & you don't have that little icon on your screen saying 62 ect.... A region selection would also be great!!","5"
"102","VIC Fires","Great app! I've been using the app for a few years and still have not found a better one for up to date fire incident information. It's quick and easy to use. Well worth the small price.","5"
"103","VIC Fires","A great app. Faster than the new Vic Emergency website and the maps are far less clunky. Information is accurate (same info as Vic Emergency site - just far easier to find and read).","5"
"104","VIC Fires","This is a very helpful app as it gives you the location of fires in relation to you. A few useful improvements would be Total Fire Ban notification, the new fire rating index for the day and the ability to list incidents by time (as well as distance as it is currently). Good work","4"
"105","VIC Fires","Easy to use, more useful data than the fire ready app. Can actually scroll to look at surrounding areas. Great app.","5"
"106","VIC Fires","I have both the CFA app and this. The CFA app is more cluttered, and contains any number of incidents that aren't fires ... But this app seems to miss the odd fire that the CFA manages to catch. It may be an idiosyncrasy for my particular area (the Mornington Peninsula) but I think I'll keep both apps available ... Just to be sure.","4"
"107","VIC Fires","A very good app. Informative and much more stable than the CFA app. It would be great to have this implemented into the notifications centre, so alerts can be  used.   Also, the ability to set 'watch zones' with an adjustable radius would be great.  Otherwise, this is the best CFA incident app available.","4"
"108","VIC Fires","Brilliant app that has worked reliably through the last fire season. I highly  recommend this app over the cheaper (free) and cumbersome, clunky offering from CFA. You get what you pay fore I always say!","4"
"109","VIC Fires","This ap started off great excellent, two days later it wont even open. very dissapointing.  I see that there is going to be a fix hopefully it is soon as bush fire season is here already..","4"
"110","VIC Fires","This is a fantastic app no bugs at all. I would recomend it to everyone especially people in high risk fire areas.  Great app","5"
"111","VIC Fires","Great App, any help is good help in fire season, and it keeps me updated even whn I'm at work - it's hard enough living on a farm without worrying about closeness of fires in this Season","5"
"112","VIC Fires","Brings up Fire information not found error every time you launch the app.  Not sure how reliable this app is. ","3"
"113","VIC Fires","Seems to be easier to work and more reliable than the CFA app! Thank you for this app.","5"
"114","VIC Fires","I do like the option to go back to the old icons we got used to. 1 extra star for that. And what's with the bus icons? Looks like a bus not a fire truck. It's also too big and just doesn't need to be there.","3"
"115","VIC Fires","Good info in the app itself however i should be able to restrict my alerts to one area and receive notifications for certain areas.","3"
"116","VIC Fires","Fantastic app that provides basic info on CFA incidents in Victoria. Much easier to use than the CFA app so worth the small cost. Would love a radio stream feature!","4"
"117","VIC Fires","What a fantastic App. Beats DSE, CFA and BOM Hollow. Up to date fire and weather information. Easy to use, faster by factor of 10 to the websites. Fire authorities should publicise this app.","5"
"118","VIC Fires","There is no explanation for the Coloured/Shaded circles/shapes which come in various sizes at each fire location. Sometimes Blue sometimes Yellow. Add an explanation to the app. Otherwise it's a good app as it shows wind direction.","4"
"119","VIC Fires","The best fire info app by far, and now I can set up a watch zone and get notifications :)","5"
"120","VIC Fires","Usually reliable but keeps crashing as soon as you open. Not a good time for it to be crashing!!","3"
"121","VIC Fires","Good App, far exceeds the capabilities and information supplied on CFA's own app 'Fire Ready' (ALL versions) This is my second summer using this app.","5"
"122","VIC Fires","I usually love this app but since the update I can't access it as it keeps crashing???","4"
"123","VIC Fires","This app worked well initially but now has crashed. Tried deleting/reinstalling to no avail. Needs some way of clearing past alerts. At one stage I had 48 new showing up.","2"
"124","VIC Fires","Such a well structured app that the Government should be subsidising and promoting. Get with the times!!!!","5"
"125","VIC Fires","Have loved this app but HATE the latest update ! The Advice / Warnings are too hard to read as you have to actually go into each one to find out a town / suburb name","3"
"126","VIC Fires","Really needs to let you filter alerts based on a saved location, rather than current location.","1"
"127","VIC Fires","Just did the update, now the app wont open. Pls help!!! Love the app normally!","5"
"128","VIC Fires","Read lily useful app but please bring back the map this fire feature. Then you'll get 5 stars","4"
"129","VIC Fires","Great app but new update doesn't show number of units on scene and that seems like a step back","4"
"130","VIC Fires","The updated version of this app continually crashes and will not stay open long enough to even view the data. This version requires urgent repair being bushfire season.","1"
"131","VIC Fires","This is a great app good mapping fast refresh much better than the CFA app.  Good work","5"
"132","VIC Fires","Any chance of listing the DSE controled burn off's as well","5"
"133","VIC Fires","Great app; regularly updated.  Plots alerts and fire advisories on map for clear communication.  Works well.","4"
"134","VIC Fires","This app doesn't automatically update when you reopen it therefore someone who doesn't know exactly how the app works could easily miss an emergency warning. Very dangerous.","1"
"135","VIC Fires","Doesn't work just crashes","5"
"136","VIC Fires","Great on the iPad but won't open on iPhone.","3"
"137","VIC Fires","Ridiculous graphics that get in the way of actually seeing any information, and it crashes every time I've used this app. Bring back the old CFA Fire App. This is garbage.","1"
"138","VIC Fires","The distances from a fire do not show on my iPhone 5. As a firefighter, I might find this useful. It also makes it impossible to sort the fires by proximity. Strangely, I do get this information on my iPad.","1"
"139","VIC Fires","This Application is a total failure.   The App was successfully downloaded.   When selected the App commences to open but then completely shuts down time and time again.   It was a waste of money and time.","1"
"140","VIC Fires","Since update app stays open for a minute at most then closes, not happy as I'm trying to monitor a fire that is very close to my town ATM not good considering the coming season that has started early as it seams","1"
"141","VIC Fires","Extremely useful app that helped me during the fires in Halls Gap","5"
"142","VIC Fires","Great and easy to use. BZ","5"
"143","VIC Fires","Crashes, doesn't load for ages and just times out, out of date, not user friendly. First time I regret wasting a measly $1","1"
"144","VIC Fires","It's coming up with an error on opening.","3"
"145","VIC Fires","The app won't open at all. I deleted and re- downloaded it but no luck!  Great for the coming fire season!!!!!","1"
"146","VIC Fires","I have used this app for the last few fire seasons. I also use the Fire Ready app. I think the maps are much more useful (I hate the way that the icons go all over the place when you zoom in with the Fire Ready app.) and the hotspot overlay is particularly good at giving an indication of fire location and severity.   I have done some research ( very quick response to my questions - thanks) and some features I did not understand now make sense and make this app even better.  You can select options that overlay colored shading approximating the area where an official warning or advice is in place. When you select a fire from the drop down menu it is highlighted on the map (you can select Google or Apple maps and this feature can be turned off in Apple maps)  Emergency warnings are on a separate drop down menu ranked in order of severity. Again they link to the specific location on he map.  The app is intuitive, the wind direction is great - helpful in assessing current potential risk. You can tap on the wind direction arrow and get detailed levels of information on wind, temperature and air pressure. Tapping on the graph icon creates a graph of the information for several hours so you can see the trend!  The hot spots are useful in gauging the intensity of the fire and potentially where main fire activity is. This tends to be most useful for larger fires that have been going for long enough to be picked up by Sentinel Hotspots which feeds to this app.  The ease of accessing fires ranked by distance to your current location is also great.   Highly recommend this app if you live in a fire zone. I use it along side the Fire Ready app as I can get good notifications from that app while his is more intuitive and informative.  Being able to set up watch zones as in the Govt app would be the cream on the cake","5"
"147","VIC Fires","Would be good if it didn't keep crashing both on ipad and iPhone","1"
"148","VIC Fires","Bring back number of units on scene please!!! To make the app awesome again....","4"
"149","VIC Fires","This app is no good. It freezes every time you try to move around the map! Bug needs fixing!!","1"
"150","VIC Fires","Not reliable, continuously crashed and would not update on an extreme fire danger day.","2"
"151","VIC Fires","This app crashes all the time. Save your $1.00 for something that works!! Very disappointed!!!!","1"
"152","VIC Fires","It is impossible to open this program. It asks for permission to use my location and then disappears immediately. It is a waste of money!  very disappointing.  Jan Hall","1"
"153","VIC Fires","Simple and concise. Love having wind and satellite hotspots.","5"
"154","VIC Fires","Great app","5"
"155","VIC Fires","This app will load and when is does , it will crash. ????????","2"
"156","VIC Fires","FIX THIS QUICK!!","1"
"157","VIC Fires","Need to be able to control badge notifications. Need to be able to select notifications or turn it off  Only interested in alerts or warnings not every notification listed","5"
"158","VIC Fires","About a year ago it was really handy, but becomes less reliable with every update. Can't even open the latest version - just crashes.","3"

"1","St John Ambulance First Aid","This app could almost be a good service to the community ... if the price wasn't so hideously greedy, and that is certainly something I have to take into consideration when giving stars.  On the other-hand, the app deserves an extra star or two for having to be purchased by people who aren't aware of Australia's emergency numbers but presume to correct what is already correct. You people must feel like complete dicks at this point, and so you should. As for the individual who claims to be a first aid attendant, but also thinks 112 is not an Australian number ... sheesh! Change professions, please. Quick!  Back to the App, the information provided does skim across details, but I guess you are trying to simplify things for the benefit of people in emergencies. That excuse hardly washes though as you could easily include more info and keep the emergency and CPR stuff accessible.  I'm not overly impressed for an app of this kind and by this particular company. The price is even less impressive.","3"
"2","St John Ambulance First Aid","Ok.  It has good basic information but there are some critical problems.  999 Is great for UK but useless for Australia.  What about 911 for US customers, what about Brazil and South America?  These apps are released worldwide...  are all the emergency medical numbers there?  (NO)  Emergency numbers should be hyperlinked so that you can press to connect.  That would be useful.  It would also be good if versions were available which dealt with specific emergencies which occour in the main continents....  Such as Stingers in Australia, types of snakes and spiders in particular continents...  Good basic stuff...  However.  Please complete a real first aid course, as this only has the basics...  Also CPR should have its full details displayed so that ANYONE can pick up the phone and KNOW what to do.  Again....  Good start, but MUST have some updates to make this a really good app!","4"
"3","St John Ambulance First Aid","I have actually done the Senior First Aid Course, and this is great to have with you in case you either forget something minor, or for someone else to use.   And just so we're clear, 112 is an emergency number in Australia. And it's free. And it works without reception or a SIM card in your phone (true). The reason 000 is promoted is because you are charged for the phone call, and all the emergency services get a kick-back from the phone company for promoting it.   Also, you would be surprised how many people don't know how to do basic first aid. So if anything unfortunate happens to you, you can always just pass the phone to them and get them to follow basic instruction.  ","5"
"4","St John Ambulance First Aid","I bought this app in spite of a poor review because it was about 5 times as big as other 1st aid apps, so presumed it had more content; and because it was the first version from a major and trusted supplier of 1st aid training and goods. Frankly I wasn't expecting it to be great but hoped it would get better in time.   Yet I actually think it is excellent as is. Yes it needs international phone numbers, perhaps a search engine (unless I missed it) etc. But I highly recommend it - it's easy to find information and gives me reassurance that I have this information handy at all times. ","4"
"5","St John Ambulance First Aid","I bought this app over the others because it was from a well known national organisation (i.e. I could trust that the information was accurate and the app was comprehensive). I'd previously completed SJA first aid courses so I know they know their stuff.  So far it delivers. It's simple to use, comprehensive and full of accurate information.  It's version 1.0, so some might see areas for improvement - I suggest to them - send SJA a suggestion, I'm sure they'll consider adding it to future versions.  SJA is a very well known and large organisation and their sole business is first aid - THAT'S why you should be able to rely on this app - and future versions and tweaks to this app.  Overall, great app.  To the reviewer below: 112 is the energency number from all Australian mobile phones as well as 000. Sure the app could be improved but that's what the reviews are for :) SJA will take it into consideration in app updates.","5"
"6","St John Ambulance First Aid","This app covers some of the basics well, which is what you need in an emergency, when your adrenalin is pumping and you're trying to remember what to do.  However, it is a British app that has not been adapted well to Australian conditions. The emergency numbers are incorrect and it leaves out snakebite, spider bite and stings. As Australia has the most venomous snake, spider, mammal and jellyfish in the world, that is a serious omission.  Some potential improvements: -a ticking and flashing metronome to help time CPR correctly. -make emergency phone numbers clickable, so the phone will dial them. -use the gps to determine location, then provide the correct emergency number throughout. -use the gps to determine address to tell the emergency operator. ","2"
"7","St John Ambulance First Aid","This is a good app for anyone that knows only a little about first aid. the emergency numbers in here are not for Australia they are for The UK. All European Union countries have 112 number. very nice app. being a first aid attendant myself i know all this information. just good to have this to show a person exactly what ur going to do, that's if the conscious.","5"
"8","St John Ambulance First Aid","Just to clarify the emergency number issue. From the AMCA (AU Emergency calls service website) 112 is the GSM international standard emergency number which can only be dialled on digital mobile phones.  112 can be dialled anywhere in the world with GSM coverage and is automatically translated to that country's emergency number.","4"
"9","St John Ambulance First Aid","I had hoped for much more content. Fractures took up 11/2 screens with only a picture of two legs bound together, asthma the same. No separate first aid for children. Chest pain got 2 pages for conscious & 4 for unconscious, but asked if the first aider has a defribrilator, I'm a nurse so I know that you generally find them in ambulances & hospitals where first aid is being handled by the experts!! No real info on spider or snake bites. Very disappointing. The information is too minimal & generic to be of any use.","1"
"10","St John Ambulance First Aid","The app got the emergency number wrong for Australia. Critical error for an app that is deaigned to be used in emergency.  Most information are very basic and borderline useful. While others would be more useful with video instructions.  Overall, the app is poorly planned and designed. Not a very useful first aid app.","2"
"11","St John Ambulance First Aid","I have been waiting for St Johns to release a first aid app believing it would  put the other first aid apps to shame. $5 is $3 too much given the amount of content. I was expecting a digital version of their study guide which has extensive material. Guess i'll have to wait for updates.","2"
"12","St John Ambulance First Aid","With a little more work, this could be a great application.  More audio and some video would be great.","4"
"13","St John Ambulance First Aid","I purchased this App from the Australian iTunes Store, and unfortunately the information seems more relevant to the US. eg. the emergency contact number in Australia is 000 NOT 911. Some of the treatments are also out of date. eg Severe Bleeding. Another problem is that some text is hidden behind the next page bar at the bottom of the screen.","1"
"14","St John Ambulance First Aid","I bought this app over other first aid applications as St John is recognised as the provider of first aid courses/kits. I hope that there a updates planned and basic bandaging is included.","2"
"15","St John Ambulance First Aid","This app should never have been released in Australia!   I hear St John Ambulance Australia is releasing some iPhone apps this year. Maybe they will be more suited to our market. Keep an eye out!","1"
"16","St John Ambulance First Aid","There isn't much to this app - just a couple of dozen pages. Reasonably organized but lacks depth. There are no videos of how to do CPR for example. The section on diabeties was fragmented. Broken bones? Just put it in a splint! Lists phone numbers for one country only, no way to customize anything.  Not worth $4.99....","1"
"17","St John Ambulance First Aid","Very poor, dissapointing app. So basic, not even relevant Australian emergency no.! Bought because St John is most recognized, not worth a dollar!","1"
"18","St John Ambulance First Aid","Not detailed. Wrong emergency number for Australia.","1"
"1","Hazards Near Me NSW","For an important and potentially lifesaving app it needs some refining.  Living next to the bush, the first thing I want to see when I open the app is today’s fire ratings for my area and any other important information such as total fire ban, fires or other incidents in my watch zone (with a different appearance for resolved incidents and the option to select if resolved incidents appear).  The map is secondary.  In fact a Widget that tells me today’s fire rating and total fire ban advice from my phones lock screen would be so useful. You currently have to open 3 sub folders & scroll down before you get to this info.   An option to send a daily notification of today’s fire rating based on your location could also be helpful.  Also when there’s a notification of a fire it would be better if it updates to show it has been resolved instead of having to click on each one listed to find out it’s no longer a threat. It wastes time when there could be multiple fires. It also stays there and doesn’t give me the option to remove or hide it & it doesn’t show if you’ve already viewed it.  Knowing where fires (or other emergencies) are is undeniably helpful, particularly when I’m away from home so this app is good for that. Notifications are usually pretty quick too.","3"
"2","Hazards Near Me NSW","I think this app provides an excellent service to people living in, or travelling to, bushfire prone areas. However, living in an area that is currently threatened by bushfires, I have a major suggestion that would help improve the service a lot. The update frequency has been good as the fires developed over the last few days, but the information given on each report has been exactly the same for each threat level even though the fire has clearly grown and moved substantially in that time period. If you are going to provide people with this sort of information they are going to want to be able to rely on its accuracy. The information given (locations and size of the fires burning) should be as accurate as possible to allow people to visually understand the level of threat posed to them so they can make informed decisions about evacuation. I think the RFS are doing an amazing job on all fronts in trying to contain the catastrophe we are currently experiencing, this is simply a tiny bit of constructive criticism that could help save more lives and homes in the future.","4"
"3","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is a great app and hats off to the team responsible for this, especially during the big fires in NSW the latter parts of 2019. Some suggestions to improve the usefulness even more could be:  1. Allow the user to go back and review historical fire front overlays on the map. That way we can see where it’s moved in the past day, past week etc... and therefore see what’s changed over time, like when viewing rain radar information on any weather app. Some sort of slider bar would do the trick when in map mode. At present I have to remember where it was yesterday and try and compare that to what it looks like today.   2. Enhance the map view by (if possible) showing where the active fire fronts are in a different colour. The big fires of 2019 had enormous coverings of grey to indicate its size, but this doesn’t distinguish between where it’s burning now and where it may have been extinguished along its perimeter. For now we have to assume if it’s not moving then it’s been successfully dealt with.   3. Enhance the watch zones with circular rings instead of just a semi transparent circle indicating - say - each kilometre away from your watch zone point. This combined with point 2 above would help tell the story for the user as to how fast it is approaching, and how far away it is now. That, or a ruler would help.  These are just suggestions to make this already great and valuable app, even greater.  Thanks guys. PC","5"
"4","Hazards Near Me NSW","Whilst I have found this app very helpful and informative, I have noticed that it really isn’t as accurate with updated information with regards to current situations, which increases my anxiety because I don’t know what to believe.  For example, due to lots of smoke in my area today, I checked the app, which showed a fire 4 Klms from me. However, when the local Fire Station put a status on Facebook, they reassured their followers that there are no active fires in my region and the smoke was from a fire outside of this area, which means that the app is wrong. It’s also confusing with the white diamond when it says it’s not applicable to me.  I also tried to add Watch Zones but when I use my current location, it said that it was for New South Wales only but... I AM in New South Wales.  I realise that thousands of people have obviously downloaded this app in the last few days due to the dangerous weather conditions, but it really needs to be more accurate with current events.","4"
"5","Hazards Near Me NSW","I live in the blue mountains NSW and the previous app was a lifeline. As someone living with a mobility disability it saved my life during black summer fires.  I was able to trust the notifications, focus on key information relevant to my location, and not get distracted by irrelevant ones. This “upgrade” is an excercise in trying to be all things to all people and, as a result, becoming totally useless. It’s not intuitive, has too many types of ‘hazards’ instead of just fires, and I’m now ambivalent to any notifications that I receive because there are too many of them and I can’t clear the ‘read’ notifications from the homepage view. I’ve tightened my watch zones, turned off as many notification options as possible - but still I don’t trust it and found it wastes my time. So guess what, I don’t use it!! That kind of defeats the purpose doesn’t it.  What’s gone wrong?? Politics at play, too many chefs, and definitely designed by people who do not have lived experience in using the original FNM app in a real crisis.  Bring back the fires near me app - before people die.","1"
"6","Hazards Near Me NSW","I’m not sure why the change but now, after an incident has been resolved, the information about it is no longer accessible as far as I can see.  That is a shame.  If it isn’t possible to read the information promptly (Asleep?  Busy with other issues perhaps?) you can’t find out what has happened in your local area. I would much prefer to be better informed. This morning I have woken to very smoky skies but there is no information on what is going on.  I saw a fire nearby yesterday afternoon and I suspect it’s the cause but there was no information on it at the time and there still isn’t. I really like this app but it’s not as accurate or informative as it could be - yet. I also have a question to ask.  In the ‘type’ cell, what is covered by the term ‘other’?","3"
"7","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great App that has been invaluable as one source of information in managing the personal fire safety of my family during, and escaping, the South Coast. As a recent heavy user, I have provided below some constructive improvement observations for your consideration.  Identify the active fire front with size/intensity indication, movement history and predicted path. (perhaps as a layer that can be turned on/off) Add the longer term Fire Movement Prediction map that has been generated and shared as a static image (on the RFS Website) also as a layer that can be turned on/off? Integrate the Live Traffic Road closures (also as a layer that can be turned on/off?) Provide access to the list of notifications provided for a watch area from the application-we received the alert through the notifications but would be handy to associate/review with the Watch Zone Scale the Watch Zones with increasing alert levels as the fire gets closer through the Watch Zone Identify Evacuation Centres and RFS crews Tweak the colours and icons for the fires to provide clearer single item information relevant to the users needs/things of importance (e.g. currently the fire icons in blue indicate both under control and out of control fires-which is a little confusing) Smooth out the Layer-Map integration, it gets a bit choppy at times when scrolling around","4"
"8","Hazards Near Me NSW","Taken a good app and “improved “ it to make it worse. But then again it is a government app. The most frustrating: 1. Notifications are not removed unless you view them - regardless of the status. So the fire is out but the notification remains. 2. Fixed view on the map when starting covering only a couple of km. Have to zoom out every time (unlike previous). 3. Fire warnings don’t update with the warning. Notifications say TFB but go to the warnings and there are no TFB in the state!  Update:  We’ll today I got the same long cut/paste developer response as everyone else.  I can say that #2 is still an issue, but of course can’t tell about #1 and #3 for 6 mths (when the fire season starts).  But more issues with addition features - can’t disable tsunami and flood alerts (despite living at 2000’ ASL) but can disable fire alerts!  Go figure.  So still 2 stars for wrecking a formerly good app.  Will update if they ever get it right.","2"
"9","Hazards Near Me NSW","Since the update from Fires Near Me to Hazards Near Me it has become really annoying to use. Instead of opening up with the map showing where the hazards/fires are you now have to find the Incidents tab and click on that, but it doesn’t show where the incident in relation to my set watch zone. When you click on map it shows nothing so you then have to click on My Watch Zone to see what incident is where. It’s become really annoying and time wasting to use the app. I’ve actually switched off the notifications today because it was going off for every incident within the Sydney basin! Switching off the notifications kinda defeats the purpose of the app, doesn’t it? Please bring back a version similar to what it was before when it was just Fires Near Me. That was, at least, useful and functioned properly.","2"
"10","Hazards Near Me NSW","The app is great at letting you know when the fire enters your watch zone but the notifications once it’s in the watch zone is ridiculous. The fire is that big (gospers mtn) that you get notified every few minutes of a new fire in your zone but it isn’t related to the zone selected. I got over 100 notifications between 10pm & 5am (not to mention the 75 between 3pm & 10pm) telling me a fire has moved into my zone but not 1 of them affected my zone. Reduced the zone to minimum (5km) but still in zone. Turning notifications off. I suggest the fire be split into suburbs or sections to reduce the notifications to ones that affect you. I’m at a point now I don’t even pay attention to notifications & just use the map. Notifications... off...","3"
"11","Hazards Near Me NSW","This has been a really fantastic app to use, especially with the extreme bushfires occurring in Australia at the moment.  To further improve this app for the future, it would be great if the developer could overlay additional information on the map, such as wind direction and the air quality index. I’ve been flipping between this app and the AirVisual app to get situational awareness of bushfire locations, wind direction, and air quality (eg. Trying to work out how bad the smoke is in Canberra, even though Canberra doesn’t have fires in it). Not sure how much effort would be involved to merge the information on the same map in the app and yet still make the app easy for people to use. Will leave that up to the developer to decide.","5"
"12","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is a great app that really helps me understand where the fires are that impact me in the Central Tablelands. My only suggestion would be to allow the user to determine the distance from a fire using their watch zone when they are out of the watch zone rather than using location services. I work in Sydney during the week so it is hard for me to determine if a fire is moving closer to my home as the app only displays the distance using location services so in my case the CBD of Sydney. Apart from that the app is a lifesaver. Keep up the great work and thanks to all the firies working tirelessly to keep us safe during this ongoing catastrophic event.","5"
"13","Hazards Near Me NSW","A great App to keep informed about fire activity in your area but would be even better if on the map the bigger fires show the actual fire front maybe as a yellow line ( or small flame icon) on the side of the fire that is most active. (Fire front/s). This way you can see which way the fire front is moving.   Currently the app shows fire areas that have basically burnt out (sometimes weeks ago given current horrible conditions) and it is hard to tell where the Actual fire front / immediate threat is and can cause undue concern if it still showing older burnt out areas that are of little immediate concern.   Keep up the amazing good work NSW RFS. Hero’s in everyone’s eyes and hearts.","4"
"14","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app and notification on fires in the region. When fire starts up the app is good at updating the relevant information .... but I have found being in an area that is currently threatened by the Namadgi fire, the updates are very very few and far between. I’ve noticed it’s almost on a 24 hr basis that the map is update to current and relevant information. Not knowing how far the distance is from icon point to fire ground I’ve used the app less and less for current up to date reliable information and had to rely on social media, radio and television (which doesn’t bother me) but current reliability on activity is definitely not this app’s strong point.","4"
"15","Hazards Near Me NSW","So many notifications (need option to turn off everything other then emergency changes and actual fires).  Otherwise spammy info constantly will just make everyone turn notifications off, then they miss critical ones when badly needed   Also inaccurate sometimes in times of greatest need. Why?   Otherwise great, but seriously why can’t resources by committed to get this right?  Constant apologies and excuses flowing from the rfs but surely this is an IT / software issue.  Some visibility into why its so hard to keep it accurate or a new development effort and $ allocated badly needed","3"
"16","Hazards Near Me NSW","We are very appreciative of the development of an app like this. It makes us much calmer when there are fires in our area. Just a few suggestions. The information in the My Notification does not always match the map information. The My Notification often says incident resolved but if you go to the map it states in status that it is still being controlled or out of control. It would be less confusing if the status was updated to under control in both places before the incident resolved notification is given.","4"
"17","Hazards Near Me NSW","The Fires Near Me app was really good. I wish it hadn't been upgraded to this Hazards Near Me version. Notifications from FNM used to open the map with my notifications areas marked, and I could see at a glance where the fires were, then go into any one for more detail. Whereas notifications from HNM just invariably open up to an incident resolved message, leaving me to dig through menus until I can see the overall picture of what's happening around me. I used to be able to quickly check on fires from which the prevailing winds would be bringing smoke, in addition to those closer at hand. This allowed me to open/close windows and plan my day so that my lungs were looked after properly. Not now though :-(","2"
"18","Hazards Near Me NSW","I had the hell of a time logging in to the new Hazards Near Me app. It kept telling me “helpfully”, “Either your user name or password is wrong, but I’m not telling you which.” It also refused to let me log in via FaRcebook, saying that that feature was closed for renovations or something. 🙄 I finally fluked logging in using Apple. I guess the good news is that in all the confusing toing and froing, and all the verification codes, I now have new passwords to everything and, for all I know, a whole new identity and citizenship in another country.   After all that, the app works exactly like it used to.   I was beginning to think I’d have to give up and sit on my roof on a folding chair with a pair of binoculars on every high fire danger day. 🙄😃","2"
"19","Hazards Near Me NSW","Looks nice but the IA makes very little sense “Home” should navigate to the general map with everything for a quick view. “Maps” should go to the map selection (currently in Home). “Watch Zones” > select zone should navigate to the full map of watch zone with a button to edit, it should not automatically open an edit panel.  Please please please also make notification bubbles disappear or have incidents marked as read automatically when an incident is over so I don’t have to manually open the app and click a notification that is already irrelevant.","4"
"20","Hazards Near Me NSW","Found app very helpful with recent fires on mid north coast and my first time using it. Have noticed a few things that may need to be reviewed and improved if possible: 1. Not sure if the shaded areas shown on the map are active fires and map legend doesn’t explain what this is or means.  2. Would be useful to know via a time stamp how recent the information I’m looking at actually is. Hoping it isn’t hours old as it’s being used to make an informed decision.  3. Have had multiple bursts of push notifications with an hour or two saying a fire has entered my watch zone yet when I view the map nothing (ie shaded area) is visible.  4. The list function is a little misleading in that the distance of fire appears to be related to where the fire classification label is placed rather than the distance to the app user which is what was of particular interest at the time.  5. The shaded areas sometimes weren’t shown as previously and then reappeared an hour or two later.","4"
"21","Hazards Near Me NSW","Since the new version of the app it is no longer necessary to input your location BUT you can’t input any location.   Since becoming aware of the app I estimate equal usage putting in other locations and having a list of fires based on that distance from there. This has been helpful if I am considering traveling as I could access details of fires where I am traveling to or areas I am traveling through. It was also helpful to assist friends who may not have access to the app themselves.   In future versions would you also include the notification date and time for each fire to assist with activation of Get Ready plans.","3"
"22","Hazards Near Me NSW","Generally it is a good app providing a useful source of information. I particularly like the watch zones idea, especially if you can work out the issue described in other reviews about multiple notifications about the same fire in the watch zone.   The thing that I feel is really discouraging me from having notification on is the Total Fire Ban notifications.  You should allow people to limit those notifications to a specific region (or their current location). I honestly don’t care about any total fire bans except for ones that are in MY region as the others have no impact on me.","4"
"23","Hazards Near Me NSW","What have they done to this app?  Fires near me was a great app; this new version is terrible. Issues include:  * The map view is constantly asking you to setup a watch zone, even though you have one. * Navigating from the map page (the logical “home” page) to an incident notice is clumsy and time consuming. * The app sends you notifications of incidents but quite often when you view the incident it’s been resolved. Why can’t a follow up notification remove the “incident indicator on the apps icon. Almost every incident I look at has been resolved by the time I look at it (the app is on the home page of both my iPhone and iPad so I notice the notifications every time I look at my device. This annoyance is going to drive some users to remove the app or ignore the warnings (because they are no longer relevant. * It’s very difficult to give feedback to the RFS (developer) and when you do there is no feedback  I live in a rural area and this app is vital for my family’s safety. Please fix it, make it as good as it once was!","2"
"24","Hazards Near Me NSW","I’m a retired RFS Inspector that have had extensive experience in fire mapping and GIS within the service. While the app is very good there a few problems that need to be corrected.  I have an older device (iPad) which will not except this version. When asked to download an earlier version it reverts to the original Fires near me which then asks to update again. As a result it just goes round and around.  On later devices incidents resolved stay on the app once queried they can’t be deleted.  Also the advice screen can’t be moved down to show more of the map screen where the fire is.","3"
"25","Hazards Near Me NSW","I live in rural NSW and the alerts add an extra level of awareness that’s potentially life saving for us. As some people keep pointing out the app isn’t perfect and the notifications aren’t always spot on, it’s your responsibility to be aware of what is going on around you and this app is perfect in helping my awareness, but you have to be vigilant and keep an eye out yourself also.   The app is brilliant for the function it performs, looking forward to seeing further improvements/developments also but you’re definitely on the right track with this one.","5"
"26","Hazards Near Me NSW","I received a notification that a vehicle was on fire on my road. The little map that goes with the notification shows an incident icon, yet the bigger map where I go to see exactly where it is shows no icon on the map rendering it useless. The small map with the notification can be moved around to find a landmark (in this case a creek), but it is awkward and I don’t understand why the icon isn’t on the larger map. In regional areas, there aren’t many cross streets/roads to get a point of locality, the information needs to be shown on the map.","4"
"27","Hazards Near Me NSW","I’ve used this app for some time and found it very useful. The new version needs to make it easier to go to and view one’s watch zone(s). ATM you have to search or scroll around for them from the main map screen or look at your watch zone with over half of the screen taken up with the edit watch zone options.  My recollection of the previous app is that you were able to more readily view your watch zone and/or alerts within it. Regardless, this is something to improve in the new version.","3"
"28","Hazards Near Me NSW","When this app was previously known as ‘Fires near me’ and was under the auspices of the NSW Rural Fire Service, it was accurate and reliable.  The end user was reassured to have it.  However since it has been ‘improved’ and now includes an all hazards approach it seems to have lost that reliability that the community needs.  Tonight for example a notification was raised for a fire within 200m of my home.  However the ‘map’ view did NOT indicate any active incident.  This is promoting a ‘boy who cried wolf’ situation if the app cannot be relied upon.  I felt much safer with the old app.","3"
"29","Hazards Near Me NSW","We get good information about fires within our watch zones but as soon as the hazard is resolved you can not check the exact location as it goes to “incident resolved” and you can get to the map. Please let us see the map as to where the incident occurred.  The notifications should be able to disappear after visiting the map once the incident has been resolved. Currently they stay around for about a day and you don’t know if there was a new notification on the app icon.","4"
"30","Hazards Near Me NSW","I’ve been using this great app for years when it was called Fires Near Me NSW. The upgrade (& name change) sounded great adding other emergency info but it is now annoying & needs some changes. It gives me alerts & a splat on the icon, which is exactly what I need of course but opening the app does show me those warnings!! Doesn’t even give me a splat to tell me where to look for them, just have to dig around until you get it. Also, I have to open the app & still down to the warnings just to get rid of the splat - even if they are a month old! This renders the splat useless unless I clear it multiple times a day!","2"
"31","Hazards Near Me NSW","With alot of apps notifications there can sometimes be a little image to go with the notification. After waking up with 4 hazard reductions burns on my home page, this app needs these! As i had to click into the app stressed only to find that they were planned burn offs. If icons were to be used in these notifications they should show the same icons as the map key icons. I really hope that this gets taken into consideration to improve the stressful situation of bushfire information in Australia.","3"
"32","Hazards Near Me NSW","While the app is great for overall view of fires that are happening etc it would be better if once a fire in the area is out and no longer a threat that it be removed. They stay on the list with the advise level etc but are no longer burning and then make it difficult to know which are new and current fires. There are fires on the list that happened weeks ago that are still on there.  For scale of the affected areas leave the map grey for the areas that have burnt but remove the actual icon.","4"
"33","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app works well but has one annoying feature.   When you click on an old notification, and it’s now resolved, the app immediately dumps back to the screen for the list of notifications. This doesn’t allow you to actually see where the incident was. You are forced to try to capture a screen shot before it returns.   Please leave the location visible and then click ok to return to the notifications.","4"
"34","Hazards Near Me NSW","The latest update aggregates fire and flood data into the one app, which given the recent events is a great idea. However, I'm unable to customise what level of notification I receive about floods. All notification types are on, and the toggles are greyed out. For different watch zones I'm going to have different levels of interest in hazards, so not being able to customise the notifications will mean unwanted/unnecessary notifications coming through.","4"
"35","Hazards Near Me NSW","Hello, we have been obsessively using this app this Fire season to check where things are at. There is a fire close by that we are keeping an eye on. One suggestion I would like to offer would be adding the wind direction and possibly wind speed to the updates of the fires so that we can track what direction it’s moving in as it happens. I believe this will encourage people to prepared to evacuate because they will be able to see ahead of time if they are in the path of the fire that day even if the fire isn’t close by yet (for spot fires).","4"
"36","Hazards Near Me NSW","App will not work at all on Apple devices running iOS versions less than 13. Oh sure, you can download an older compatible version of the app, but when you open it you are notified to upgrade to the latest Apple OS! So the app will not work on older Apple devices. At all. How typically moronic circular reasoning from the Devs. This app might save lives, but only for those people running the latest Apple software. People are discriminated against if they cannot afford to buy the latest $1400 iPhone. Let the poor people die in a flood or bushfire because the developers won't run a compatible app version for older devices. Shame, the shame!","1"
"37","Hazards Near Me NSW","This update has removed some of the better features in the previous version. When the app opens, the new incident map is small and difficult to navigate. IMO it was much better to see where the incident is and then tap on it for more details.  Incidents which were resolved 3 days ago are still showing as advice.  The app hyperlink shows a number which doesn’t disappear after the app is opened.  There is no obvious way to open something to clear it. Once the app is open, then there should be a number on an internal page which needs to be opened and the number will be cleared.","1"
"38","Hazards Near Me NSW","Like many others I've used this extensively recently. That's led me to the following suggestion (I've not read every review here so it's possible this has been suggested many times over).  I'd like to know where the fire fonts are. Can they be indicated with a red edge line or some other distinguishing feature? I know fire fronts are an ever moving thing, but so is the total fire ground. Updates for one could be made at the same time as updates for the other.  Keep up the good work!","4"
"39","Hazards Near Me NSW","Fires near me has been a really helpful app we have been living in a highly dangerous area and has helped us to know when to evacuate and has put our brains at ease we who’d be lost without it my 1 piece of feedback is when you get a non applicable fire and it’s near you you get worried so Manet try to get less of those but I do understand that your busy with the actual fires just a bit of constructive criticism","5"
"40","Hazards Near Me NSW","Firstly, as an app this does a really good job. However, I don’t feel able to give it more than 1 start due to 2 flaws in the design/delivery;  1) why, in this current bushfire climate, are we still relying on “region” based apps. The current fire situation is a national crisis, yet we still rely on apps covering individual regions. Seriously, get your act together and work on a national app that everyone can use and is a single source of truth!  2) in a similar vein, why is the app only available in the Australian App Store. Is this critical information not worthy of being shared with our international visitors. Or are we so blind to the number of international visitors and tourists that come to this country.","1"
"41","Hazards Near Me NSW","Incorporating both the RFS and SES into this app for rural fire and flood warnings was a good idea. Adding Fire and Rescue (FRNSW) as well would also be appreciated.  What isn’t so good, however, is one’s inability to delete old and no-longer active notifications and warnings: That is, irrelevant and out-of-date warnings just sit around on this app, with no way to remove them, and the number is growing by the day.  Please release an urgent update that allows users to delete – or at least configure a timed automatic removal of – old warnings.","3"
"42","Hazards Near Me NSW","I like the idea about the new app regards warning for floods as well, but the fire warnings list view, you can only watch fires by advice or recent, it should have an option for distance from you in km as an option!  And the map where the fire was, it showed the incorrect spot although the address in the text was correct, and if I put my address in it’s not at my house like it used to be, but in the middle of the paddock somewhere.. So far I liked the older version, but hoping it will improve soon.","2"
"43","Hazards Near Me NSW","The App no longer supports ’Dark’ Display mode for iOS - I am unable to read notifications or navigate the menu, UNLESS I change the display back to ‘Light’.  This should be able to recognise the change and display appropriately (all my other apps do).  Also noted some people mentioning adding a dynamic 5km watch zone based on your existing location (if willing to share your location, of course) - great idea for when out and about.","4"
"44","Hazards Near Me NSW","Love this app and the information it provides However, it would be even better if there was a way to receive full updates on new or existing situations through an SMS service, ie, details on events could be sent to people’s mobile number if they sign up. This would allow people to receive basic information using satellite devices and reduces reliance on phone connectivity.","4"
"45","Hazards Near Me NSW","There’s still some basic, but serious work that needs to happen with this updated app.  1. On first opening the app hangs. Force quit and try again, black screen for seconds then opens okay. Maybe a message saying you’re gathering the latest events, or whatever. But there’s an issue there. Firebase giving any indication?  2. Badge indicating an alert or whatever just will not disappear. I’ve had “1” badge showing since it updated when there’s no alerts in the app for me.   3. The app logo with the triangle and exclamation mark looks like there’s an error with the app.  With the first issue here, it almost confirms there’s a problem with the app.   Any other app I would have dumped right away. But this is too important a service to give up on.   Here’s hoping your devs sort these out quick smart.   Isn’t it fun managing a new app? :)","2"
"46","Hazards Near Me NSW","As an RFS firefighter I find this app useful to check on out of area fires as it provides a great source of information when concerns are raised about the safety of relatives and friends. I would strongly encourage everyone to have this app installed as well as keeping regularly updated with the ABC radio during emergency situations.  Remember there will never be enough RFS/Fire and rescue resources to save every person or every property so stay informed and leave when advised.","5"
"47","Hazards Near Me NSW","Not updated regularly enough. The Tabulam fire is headed towards me and I can’t see over the ridge to see how close it’s getting and I’m finding that the map is often hours old  I am extremely grateful for everything the RFS does but this is something that everyone is pointed to when a bush fire situation is upon them and because of that I feel that more attention should be shown to this app.  We’re Australians in a drought, we all know how important fire safety is, please help us to stay safe","3"
"48","Hazards Near Me NSW","Love the app but would love to have the ability back to look up a location other than where I am. I’ve found this very helpful in the past when traveling & deciding which way to go & also talking to friends & relatives who are driving & needing to make a decision but can’t look it up themselves because they’re driving.   I would also love in this app or another to be able to look up the fire bans & fire danger levels for different areas.","4"
"49","Hazards Near Me NSW","At some stage you’ve changed the colour scheme and layout. I can now barely see the little lines in the top left corner the search symbol on the right. I cannot see any of the other things that may be in the left hand column. In fact I have just noticed that they are there; I thought you reduced the options etc! As an RFS Officer, I am a regular user.  Please follow the KIS principle. This app is too important to not be fully usable by us all.","4"
"50","Hazards Near Me NSW","The two local fires near me in the last few weeks, this app has gone off about 30 seconds before hearing the fire engines, good on ya, great work and a great app. My only gripe is the app button should have been a red colour like the old RFS app this app superseded and not blue, so when you’re in a rush to find this app it’s easier to recognise, other than that it’s truly a great app…","5"
"51","Hazards Near Me NSW","This morning I woke up seeing what looked like a new notification on the app icon, but it was a resolved incident from yesterday. Notifications and alerts need to refresh more often or the user needs to be able to clear them. I’m dreading summer enough without this app needlessly raising anxiety with alerts and notifications that have been resolved but still appear.","3"
"52","Hazards Near Me NSW","The app itself is invaluable - the watch zone functionality is great.  The problem is that there are far too many notifications. There needs to be the ability to only see emergency notifications. If I see an alert come through from the app it should be because there’s an immediate threat or update to my watch zone or current location. Nothing else. I don’t want a reminder to create an escape plan - I want to know I’m in danger.","3"
"53","Hazards Near Me NSW","Can you guys think about a better way to phrase the Status of new incidents until it is determined and investigated that an incident is in fact a real going fire. For example, smoke sightings, pile burns, car fires etc. People are on edge these days and until an incident is deemed a Going fire, maybe the Status could be classed as New or Investigating or something similar to signify that it has crews responding.","4"
"54","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is an invaluable Ap however I have cousins visiting from the UK and they are driving from Sydney to NSW but they cannot download this Ap to their iPhones.

"55","Hazards Near Me NSW","During fire season this is great but now it spams so many notifications that I’m going to have to delete it or turn off the notifications completely, which means if there’s some thing truly important I’ll miss it.  It’s turned into the definition of crying wolf.  Shame, because we need this service, but it shouldn’t spam us every day with irrelevant non-threatening hazards. I know a lot of people who have deleted the app because of this.","2"
"56","Hazards Near Me NSW","Good little app, with everything packed in. However, in the sort by menu, it be a good idea if you can also sort by distance. Plus, once you read a warning in your area, & you read it, the highlight should come off, unless the warning changes. Otherwise, looks like there more then 1 warning in your area at 1 time. Thankyou.","3"
"57","Hazards Near Me NSW","Thanks for the great App guys. Perhaps I’m doing it wrong and there’s a setting I should be using? But I’d love to have my watch region only show me the bushfires in the selected region. I’m becoming complacent and ignoring alerts because with the zone I set I get quite frequent alerts for small fires which aren’t a concern. I guess I haven’t had the app while there’s been a large fire in the area, not sure if the notification is clearly different?","4"
"58","Hazards Near Me NSW","What’s supposed to be an early warning system to prevent loss of property and lives is wrong on just about every level. You would seriously be angry if you actually had to pay for the app. In theory the app is a great idea, the downfall is the information it provides, incorrect and misleading. I have no doubt some of the information updates are correct, however some is not good enough. We live in the 21 century, this type of information should be readily available to all users, for me I’am deleting the app and going back to the old fashioned way, good luck!","1"
"59","Hazards Near Me NSW","Brilliant app. Thank you. Provides valuable information. Could the notification be turned off when an incident is resolved? Small issue but so many small burns in our area cause an alert and then resolved in quick time but notification stays on until I manually reset it.","4"
"60","Hazards Near Me NSW","Every time I open the app it prompts to turn on “location services” so it can customise alerts to my location . But I need alerts for a property different to my current personal location . This has already been set in the app so it is not really necessary to have location service’s activated. Would be good to be able to disable the prompt .","3"
"61","Hazards Near Me NSW","An excellent idea, and the app functions perfectly well, but I’ve passed right by areas where the app says a fire should be, and seen no trace of a fire or of burnt vegetation, so not sure how accurate it really is. I’ve also compared the information on the app with information on the RFS webpage map, and they show different things. Obviously, err on the side of caution, and cross check with other sources when making decisions.","3"
"62","Hazards Near Me NSW","I really hate 2 things about this app.  1. When you click on a notification from your Home Screen it doesn’t remove the notification number from the app and you have to click in to the notifications in the app to remove it.   2 once an incident has been resolved, when you click to check it and it won’t let you look at the map. Really frustrating","2"
"63","Hazards Near Me NSW","I love this app and it’s great up to date information. My only suggestion would be to be able to change what types of notifications that you receive. Living in between two areas I’m constantly getting the same information twice and multiple times a day when it’s not necessary","4"
"64","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app that provides up to date advice. HOWEVER!!!! Too many times the update alert contains no new information and is both distracting and prone to being ignored! For example. The currowan fire was last updated @ 19:00 tonight 19 Dec. it’s 19:50 and I have received over 15 updates. Seriously this not a safe system if it is just pinging. In fact I’ve received three while writing this!!!!","3"
"65","Hazards Near Me NSW","Since the change to Hazards near me there are far too many notifications for minor incidents. A lot of these minor incidents are resolved by the time you open the notification.  Please either reduce the notifications or allow users to set the types of notifications that come through.  The multitude of notifications reduce attention or desensitise the user to them.","2"
"66","Hazards Near Me NSW","Talk about getting swamped with notifications! It’s bordering on harassment. I would like the option to filter the type of notifications I receive, such as ones relevant to my watch zones. As it is I’ve reluctantly had to turn off your notifications. I hope you can implement a notification type filter into your app. Until then - I’ll be missing out on what is important for me.","3"
"67","Hazards Near Me NSW","Hey team. Wonderful job on a potential life saving app. However i downloaded it today and immediately after i set a watch zone, my phone started to over heat. I had to turn it off then delete the app. Was the hottest that I have ever felt my phone become. This may be a coding fault. Just thought i’d let you know. Apart from that, keep up the great work.","4"
"68","Hazards Near Me NSW","It’s a great app and I feel I need to have the notifications on, however it’s annoying that even if you read the notification as it pops up, this doesn’t clear it from your phone. You have to go back into the app a second time to clear the notification. Can this please be fixed?","3"
"69","Hazards Near Me NSW","Spent time and money building iPad specific app and it can only display in portrait mode like a larger iPhone version.  Also, generally find all RFS data (both on app and website) is out of date. You can be seeing a fire on horizon and not have it shown in the app... even if there are assets like helicopters and trucks visible fighting it.  Why can’t you just give us the same detailed feed used by headquarters control centre to know where live fires are?","2"
"70","Hazards Near Me NSW","I returned from overseas holiday - where i continued to receive notifications howver returned home to week long Total Fire Ban - conditions critical at my property - and the app has failed. Am deleting and reinstalling and hoping it will work however it does-not instil faith it will work when most needed. Am grateful for this service and RFS who we rely on. ❤️ But services NSW need to ensure this app will work when needed - not like USA and Maui service that failed so many lost souls 🥹","2"
"71","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app, but often the incident has been resolved by the time I look at my iPhone Morning summary. Would be great to be able to clear notifications manually, and even better have this occur automatically once opened and noted the resolved status.","4"
"72","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app has really helped because I live in Sydney in the centre of the fires. I have been in America so this app is a great way to check on our house ( we also live in bush area) the only improvement I would make is you can see how far away the fires are from your watch zone. Other then that I would advise everyone in NSW to get this app","4"
"73","Hazards Near Me NSW","I just updated with 28/12 one & it STILL does not turn horizontal....last update deleted this feature, always had done it before this.  6/1/19....smoke is in the air here now.....how come no fires listed near me???  This happens all the time!!  It seems not updated.  I see a fire listed on the map that I drove past 6 days ago & was out,  is STILL on the map as going.   Come on! This app is supposed to tell us what is around us NOW,      not days ago. Update it daily, better twice daily!!!!","2"
"74","Hazards Near Me NSW","I don’t live in NSW but I have family living in fire-prone areas, so I have the app to keep an eye on their safety. However, I can’t choose which notifications I get so I’m constantly getting “Total Fire Ban” etc warnings that I don’t need. All I want is fire notifications for my watch zones and that’s it. Being able to choose which warnings I get would be a huge help.","3"
"75","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app but would be extremely useful to see where the active fire fronts are, especially for large / ongoing/ out of control fires. Would also like to be able to have the option of seeing how the fire has moved over time - whether by entering dates or time lapse.","5"
"76","Hazards Near Me NSW","Don’t expect this application to 1) set you notification area 2) show where the actual hazard is 3) not warm you of very distant hazards those that are so remote they will not impact you.   The older application was clean simple and not attempting (& failing) to do everything all at once, all the time.   Unfortunately there is no alternative and since this is an ‘update’ the developer is already heading in the wrong direction and won’t revert to what used to work.","1"
"77","Hazards Near Me NSW","Excellent app. I don’t know what people are whinging about. People need to remember that a site that looks out may still have trees and logs smouldering that can easily flare a few days later. This combined with the website offers updated information on a regular basis. Invaluable.","5"
"78","Hazards Near Me NSW","This has been a good app for keeping up to date on bush fire incidents and setting up watch zones is very practical.   However after updating to iOS 12.4.4 their is no longer a map visible in the app but rather a beige background. Shaded area that represents bush fire is still there but there’s no indication of how close it is to nearby suburbs without the map.","4"
"79","Hazards Near Me NSW","It’s great having this app, and I’m sure it’s going to get better.  The notifications I get in my watch zone are great, however, when you view what the notification is, the notification indicator doesn’t go away (still shows a 1).  You have to go to the menu and click on the notifications again and view from there before the indicator is removed.","2"
"80","Hazards Near Me NSW","I really like this app, but the notifications disappear after I’ve viewed them on my lock screen.  It would be good if you could go back into the app later and view the past notification history so you can revisit the info if you were unable to view the advice earlier.","4"
"81","Hazards Near Me NSW","Really good app but it isn’t updated as often as it should. For example, a fire actively burning in my area was last updated 6 hours ago. I have smoke pouring into my property and have no idea what is going on.  Also, a zooming scale on the map would be very helpful. To say a fire is 5kms away doesn’t really help too much when I wish to travel and know how close certain roads are to the area burning.","3"
"82","Hazards Near Me NSW","Unfortunately this update has not fixed the systemic logical issues in the app that give the user the impression that fires are more distant than they actually are. Given people could use this app as the basis for making life changing decisions, giving users the impression they are under less threat than they actually are could have catastrophic consequences. It is likely that these issues are at least partially responsible for members of the public saying “the fire came faster than I expected”.","1"
"83","Hazards Near Me NSW","This was once a very easy app to use, showing readily available emergency information in the area that you’re in. From the time you open the app you were instantly informed on a map of any threat in your area, now you have to search to find the information wasting valuable time if you are under threat of bushfire.  Developers need to reassess the priority of information and the purpose of this app, so is the community is informed instantly of any danger in their area.","1"
"84","Hazards Near Me NSW","Would love to give 5 stars but since the update and new facelift the app has a few flaws.   Fires are no longer listed in correct places on map. Example the Heatons (freemans waterhole ) fire is listed up near Clarence town.  The other day the killingworth/m1 fire was listed over in warners bay.   I find the fires that when they are eventually listed take quite while in that  there are delays in them getting loaded on to the map. Which makes it hard to keep up to date.   This app needs  the bugs sorted or it needs to be improved before the official fire season kicks off as this is the go to to keep up to date and unfortunately right now it isn't doing what it should do.!","3"
"85","Hazards Near Me NSW","As anyone who has downloaded would know, this app is vital to keep up to date with fires near you. However I would not rely on it solely for notifications or alerts and would go directly to website for most up to date information as there is a lapse (over an hour) between to the two.","3"
"86","Hazards Near Me NSW","As a member of the RFS i think this app is great except..... the selection of an address and distance from that location is great BUT it should allow you to click  x km from my current location and it uses your GPS as you move so you are always within a watch zone.","4"
"87","Hazards Near Me NSW","I agree with everyone’s opinion about this app (being Fantastic!) and their suggestions to improve it; especially bofkincake’s ideas.  Another suggestion is to change the symbols. Some ‘out of control’ fires have the same symbol as ‘under control’.","5"
"88","Hazards Near Me NSW","As a fire fighter I found this site very helpful and informative.. A great App to keep me appraised of incidents around my Area .. Unfortunately, With recent updates to the site , I no longer am able to use it !  Required IOS levels on my phone don’t match the Apps insatiable needs.. And it will not allow me to keep using my old version which I was happy with . Very Disappointing..","2"
"89","Hazards Near Me NSW","The previous fires near me app was fantastic. But the upgrade to hazards near me is terrible. When I click from the map to the list I don’t want to see fires that are 500km away at the top of my feed. I would prefer to have fires/hazards in order of how far they are away from my location, so that I can quickly click on them for an update of the hazards condition.","2"
"90","Hazards Near Me NSW","The core functionality is great, but the constant spamming of other notifications along the lines is is your fire plan ready? undermines the value of this app. There's multiple of these per day. I recommend greatly reducing the number of notifications that aren't related to a fire near me - when you send too many they turn into noise and lose their meaning. One or two of these per fire season is enough.","2"
"91","Hazards Near Me NSW","I find this app to be a POS Not intuitive to use Is as bad as email spam with its intrusive announcements Lack of control as to what you are advised. HOW can a piss-ant grass fire 5 km away be a hazard near me? This app requires a complete rethink and a rewrite I’m deleting it from my phone and I’d recommend everyone else does too. ABC News Online and your Local ABC radio station has superior hazard reporting system BY FAR! I’d prefe to give this app ZERO STARS but the review process insists on at least one star","1"
"92","Hazards Near Me NSW","I find it clunky. I get too much info on stuff I don’t need to know, like a house fire 5km away. Often I get alerts on ‘out of control’ fires that a really hazard reduction burns. The alerts don’t go away after I have viewed them. It needs some easy tweaks. The developers need to sit down with a few users","3"
"93","Hazards Near Me NSW","Notifications are good - but the icon (red sticker) appears persistent - only clears when you look at the notification tab.  I see red sticker for notifications days ago concerning say a hazard reduction burn. Its not present on the map or in my zone when I open it. It can only be cleared if I open the notifications tab.  Please - if the hazard has passed the notification sticker should disappear.  Then when a new hazard is there I know that if a red sticker appears - I should pay attention.  Good app otherwise - have it at hand always.","4"
"94","Hazards Near Me NSW","THE FIRES NEED TO BE UPDATED MORE REGULARLY!!! I don’t know whether friends are in danger or whether I’m at risk, for example Mt George got told to hide because they couldn’t escape but the fire hasn’t even gotten to them within 24 hours! And the fires need to also be monitored better because the Hillville fire was 0ha on the chart but on the map it was 1000! This app needs serious re-modeling","3"
"95","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app is a great help with updates all the time and lots of information about fires near you,”. The app also alerts you about the bad weather conditions if in a high risk area. This app is what need to help you get through really bad fire situations.","5"
"96","Hazards Near Me NSW","Good app but when I try to view my watch zones they only open in an edit capacity. It needs an option to see the watch zones without the editing function taking up more than half the view.","4"
"97","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great idea and potential for being perfect. Biggest frustration is the notification tag in the app staying flagged when nothing in my monitoring areas - or nearby.   Frustrating when you constantly see the red number and go looking but find nothing.","3"
"98","Hazards Near Me NSW","They need to improve this app for the safety of everyone. An example of improving the app could include: - Updating it more It doesn’t update enough, where the website updates every 10 minutes.  This could be better.","3"
"99","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is the third time I’ve deleted and reloaded. So many glitches - either alerts every few minutes or none at all. Even though I had an alert zone set with all notifications on, last night it did not alert me to the fire entering the 10km zone. Anxious about the reliability of it now!","3"
"100","Hazards Near Me NSW","The app is good except that the notification do not go away after the fire is no longer active. So i keep on thinking there is more hazards when looking on my phone without going into the app","4"
"101","Hazards Near Me NSW","Since the most recent update (feb 2023) it’s now clunky.  It no longer lists incidents by distance from you.  Everything seems to require an extra step or two to use and notifications are more vague.","3"
"102","Hazards Near Me NSW","Love the app. I would like to change the notification sound to something that wakes me up.  I would also like, when I look at the list to tap on the name of the fire and have the map pop up on that spot. Thanks to the fireies for all Thiet work.","4"
"103","Hazards Near Me NSW","Hardly a useful update when it drains your battery needlessly during an emergency. The old Fires Near Me app didn’t need it, and there is no meaningful improvement that requires it. Suggest that it gets an urgent review and focus on more frequent updates so that we know what is actually happening during an emergency.","2"
"104","Hazards Near Me NSW","Getting notifications from this app when there’s a bush fire that impacts me is useful. But getting spammed by notifications for other general fire information is too much. So I’ve been forced to disable all notifications for the app because of it.","3"
"105","Hazards Near Me NSW","Notifications show up on locked phone but can’t be accessed through the app to get further info. Some fires show as Out of Control, even though there may not actually be a fire in that location, someone has just rung in a sighting of smoke in the air.   The fire diamond symbol is out of proportion with the size of the state, making it look as though the whole state of NSW is on fire once zoomed out. A poorly designed app.","1"
"106","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app is good and I do like it includes ACT. However when you click on your notifications, if that hazard is sorted, there is NO time to actually look at what or where it was!!! Fine if you’re reading your notifications immediately, but useless if it’s later. Simple fix, I’m sure…","2"
"107","Hazards Near Me NSW","After reviewing where the fires were in the app, the website was more up today within the hour. I find this disappointing whilst the general public look for this type of safety information and to avoid congestion in the wrong areas whilst there is a fire.","2"
"108","Hazards Near Me NSW","My iphone6 currently updated to the latest version of your app cannot open ! This has only just changed in the last week ! We had a fire in our area Saturday and I could not get information as cannot open this app. How many other people are being let down by this updated version our older phones cannot get !!!","1"
"109","Hazards Near Me NSW","Since “upgrade” from Fires Near Me, this has become frustrating. Instead of relevant notifications, and easily seen incidents on map, it is constantly giving notifications for irrelevant incidents/warnings. Can’t clear notifications, so they get ignored, which means real incidents can easily get missed. Finding incidents in watch zone is multiple awkward steps.  It needs to open on map of watchzone with incidents showing. When responding to incidents, FNM used to be very handy. This is not. Please bring back Fires Near Me, or allow this app to be setup to work in the way it used to.","2"
"110","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is a great app but I cannot find an explanation of the areas shaded grey around a fire area. Some are light and some are a darker grey.   Are these shades areas an indication of active fire areas or areas that have already been burnt out?  Is there some web site that explains it?","4"
"111","Hazards Near Me NSW","Vital asset - Shane it's not more regularly updated + error that shows more than one fire when there's only one, incorrectly shows how far a fire has gone on the map and take forever to accurately detail where it is and when the fire has ceased. Needs improvement for such a vital app","3"
"112","Hazards Near Me NSW","Can you pleeeeeaaase show out of control as different colour/symbol to the general yellow.  So clunky having to manually check status.  And increase the watch areas from 50km.  Fires can move very fast on hot windy days (with catastrophic fire risk). 50km is NOT enough.  Thank you","3"
"113","Hazards Near Me NSW","Again…I am getting “ server error try again” when I try to access my notification.   When this APP works it is great but as we are heading into hot temps again it would be nice if I could use this APP to stay informed of fire activity in my area and surrounds.  I delete, redownload, and nothing helps.  I access this APP on my IPAD which has the latest updates.  Help, please.","1"
"114","Hazards Near Me NSW","Not everyone has an up to date iPhone.  Some still using 5 or 6 like me. Now I can’t see anything but a screen telling me to update but then says I need IOS13. So this new upload has rendered this app useless. So if any fires start we are in big trouble. Pop ups still coming up just can’t use the app. Please refer back to previous app so we can use it.","1"
"115","Hazards Near Me NSW","I know the primary use of this app is for the Fire Services. I think it would be particularly useful to layer wind directions over the map. I’m not sure where to get that info, maybe from the BOM.","5"
"116","Hazards Near Me NSW","There is no compass indicator on the map. So no use telling us wind will change to north north east if we don’t know where that is  The mywatch zone can’t be edited. I have to delete it and create a new one if I want to change the distance","4"
"117","Hazards Near Me NSW","Useless if you live on the border... we have an emergency warning in Binna Burra QLD to act and leave IMMEDIATELY and it’s not even shown on this map.. there has to be a grey area for border residents.. Bushfires can’t see our imaginary line we have drawn and will roar straight over it one day.. Your playing with peoples lives... ONE app for ONE country and people can choose the radius around their homes... NOT good enough! This will cost lives one day!!!","1"
"118","Hazards Near Me NSW","I find the app very responsive and a great tool, my only concern is the amount of notifications. For example total fire ban days for areas of NSW I don’t live in. I’m concern that user will get notification fatigue and ignore the relevant notifications for their location.","4"
"119","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app used to be great. One of the key features was setting up notification zones or areas and getting warnings for specific alerts in that area.   Now anytime any nimby feels that we should know it’s hot, windy or wet you get multiple alerts.    There is no easy way to dismiss/acknowledge alerts and they all have to be viewed and touched individually. This is complete bs and fails any real world sanity test.   Yes you can configure to some extent.  No it doesn’t solve the issue.   Fix your app so it’s not spam delivery. Make the person who “specified” the changes use it with a work/home notification area and see how they get on.","1"
"120","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app, specially as I live in a high bush fire zone but I worka half hour from home so would really love if you had the option to save your home address then get an alert if fire started within so many kms from home","4"
"121","Hazards Near Me NSW","The fires near me app always gave a warning sound so I’d look at my phone. I can’t find a way on my phone or the app to turn this on, so unless I’m looking at my screen not aware of a new fire. Maybe I’m just missing something simple.","3"
"122","Hazards Near Me NSW","Sorry don’t like it, to many notifications that aren’t in my zone.  Can’t delete a zone that I no longer want… half of the fires are over with by the time the notification is sent…. I will be deleting this app as soon as I’ve sent this review..  sorry it not you, it’s ….. no it’s you!  bye","2"
"123","Hazards Near Me NSW","Please take away the watch zone limit, there’s no reason for it and sometimes people want to have more than ten watch zones for friends without devices. Please remember that many lives lay on this app and needs to be addressed for regularly.","3"
"124","Hazards Near Me NSW","Fires near me used to be a great app. Now having to log into this via another service, not being able to lock & leave a watch zone and turn off constant update notifications is unhelpful.  Tracking the phone is not helpful.  Not updating the status of fires over time in a watch zone is unhelpful.","1"
"125","Hazards Near Me NSW","Haven’t updated a fir that’s right outside my house in 2 hours, it’s labeled as a watch and act and it’s 241 hectors big. Not a small fire at all yet they aren’t keeping us informed, the fire was moving incredibly fast towards other of my family members and I can’t even see what’s happening with it. Leaving me stressed here on New Years.","2"
"126","Hazards Near Me NSW","Fires near me was much better. This app is not a easy to use and takes longer to find relevant information. There are too many notifications and you can not clear them until you go into each individual notification- often to find out it no longer exists","1"
"127","Hazards Near Me NSW","No obvious way of getting rid of notifications means you always have a star showing. Less ability to filter what you want to be alerted to. As a consequence of doing the update I’ve now reduced what I monitor it’s just too much noise. My advice is to remain on the old tool whilst they make this one compatible with humans.","1"
"128","Hazards Near Me NSW","Claims there are fires in locations where there are no fires at all, often states that there’s no network connection when there is, doesn’t update on actual fires and can go 24hrs or more without an update, beeps several times a day about fire bans in place which is incredibly annoying.  An all-round terrible app that isn’t worth taking seriously.","1"
"129","Hazards Near Me NSW","My alert zone is a holiday house I spend 20-30days a year in. Don’t send me “High Fire Danger” alerts all the time. I already know, that’s why I’m not there. Makes me want to turn off all alerts since I can’t turn off “only” fire danger alerts in settings. Change it asap.","2"
"130","Hazards Near Me NSW","Why was the ‘Fires near me’ app changed? Surely an effective app could have been enhanced to manage other hazards without totally stuffing functionality for users. Why remove the recognisable red branding… wait, NSW govt media folk need to fit state govt branding standards and keep all the agencies happy. Hazards should be red! Get over the politics and egos and reinstate the app that used to work!","1"
"131","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app would be great if the notification for hazards in the zones that I have made cleared once there was no more a hazard in my zone so I have deleted this app from my phone as it does not work correctly & I will not install it again until this bag is fixed!","2"
"132","Hazards Near Me NSW","Lived through black summer with this and it was great.  Now useless. Alerts stay there. Notifications don’t clear when a fire a brought under control. Very real fear that people will get used to see g red dots on the app and pay no attention.  Needs work asap.","2"
"133","Hazards Near Me NSW","Well done RFS! I have IOS version 12.5 which would run the old app but will NOT run the new version. So much for a community app.  Now I have nothing to go to. Did you actually pay for this retrograde step. Don’t bother with the meaningless cut and paste template response - just proves nobody has read this or other critical comments.","1"

"135","Hazards Near Me NSW","First of all you’re doing a brilliant job... Thank you!  Is there a reason why, on the list of fires, it doesn’t show in kilometres, how far the fires are away from us? Sue","5"
"136","Hazards Near Me NSW","Love the recent updates to the app regarding watch zones.  An extremely useful feature.   One additional feature to make the app more user friendly would be if the blue fire icon could someway show the status of the fire.    Rather than having to click on it to get to information.   Perhaps the white flame in the icon could contain a letter, such as either a   U = under control  B = being controlled   O = out of control","4"
"137","Hazards Near Me NSW","I’ve had to turn off notifications because of the volume of messages not related to alerts within my area. You can’t keep bombarding people’s devices and expect us to stay alert for the important ones. Disappointing.","2"

"139","Hazards Near Me NSW","Fires near me provided invaluable information and updates over the last few years.

Very frustrating that it is so unreliable","1"
"140","Hazards Near Me NSW","Never had a problem with Fires Near Me but this replacement App has not worked for me.

"145","Hazards Near Me NSW","Turned off notifications due to constant flow of irrelevant information. I can look out the window to see if the air is smoky! Please stick to pushing notifications that are critical and relevant to my location.","3"
"146","Hazards Near Me NSW","Totally useless now. Fires near me app was perfect. The list of faults is endless, I dont get notifications unless I open app and then they dont refresh or delete unless you actually press the report? If you need 1 million people to tell you the all the problems before you bring back fires near me, shouldnt be long!","1"
"147","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is a great app it can tell if there’s a fire near you or your family so if there’s a fire nere them you can call them to evacuate and it will tell you to evacuate","5"
"148","Hazards Near Me NSW","Sorry to say this but this app is not to be relied upon as the fire near us, its boundaries on the map has now mostly disappeared from last nights plotting. So we can’t tell just exactly where it is and where it has spread to. The data seems to be mixed up at times making it worriesome when you just know the fire is close.","1"
"149","Hazards Near Me NSW","We had a massive fire in Coalcliff with 4 houses alight and it's been well over 2 hours and there's nothing warning us of any fire.. it's in the News.. pfft give this app a miss and use Twitter. Disappointed I went to this app first.  This may be acceptable if the person who updates the info on this map is part of the 20 fire trucks that are there.","1"
"150","Hazards Near Me NSW","I can no longer use the app which has worked perfectly for years. I can no longer enter the app without first updating it but my iOS (the latest available for my device) is incompatible with it. I am offered a compatible app version but no update is forthcoming.","1"
"151","Hazards Near Me NSW","The number of notifications each day since the last update is insane. We do not need to know about every incident you are attending. Fix it or everyone will just end up deleting or switching off notifications which defeats the purpose.","1"
"152","Hazards Near Me NSW","The latest update require IOS 13 for iPhone. Some of us are using older phones and IOS 12. When I open the app it goes straight to the update screen which seems to be mandatory. Please would you make the update optional so we can still use the app with IOS 12? Thanks.","1"
"153","Hazards Near Me NSW","It's easy to see where all the fires are and the status! There are so many right now too!","5"
"154","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app definitely needs to be upgraded and improved to give actual real time information and also a feed back link Often the fire reports are quite a few hours out of date which is very dangerous.","2"
"155","Hazards Near Me NSW","Could you map the active fire front as well as the already burnt out areas this would provide better understanding. Thanks.","4"
"156","Hazards Near Me NSW","I have checked and double checked the location settings,but the app doesn’t give me distances to the hazard. I also can’t centre in on my location on the map. I am using an iPad, I have uninstalled and reinstalled,with no change.","2"
"157","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great clean new look. Looking forward to future updates, more new features and improved design.","5"
"158","Hazards Near Me NSW","Please provide the ability to set the  “fire” or “flood” hazard at main menu so that the app doesn’t default back to “All Hazards” when restarted. Also provide the ability to turn off the flood “watch and act” and “advice” buttons as can be done with Fire buttons.","1"
"159","Hazards Near Me NSW","With the fires near me app it used to come up where the hazard was, instead of a Map around my current location. Perhaps open into the Notifications page so at least you can read what the hazard is","1"
"160","Hazards Near Me NSW","It's difficult to overstate how bad this new version of the app is. I agree with others: PLEASE withdraw this version and bring back the perfectly acceptable Fires Near Me. FAR more user testing is needed before any further attempts to release this update again. Listen to your users.","1"
"161","Hazards Near Me NSW","Once the fire hits the watch zone you get honestly over a hundred notifications. This never used to be an issue until today. Otherwise the app is great","3"
"162","Hazards Near Me NSW","The previous app was great. This one is slow and clunky. It take several refreshes to get rid of notifications that are outside my watch zones. This is a big step backwards from what was an excellent app previously. Why did you want to change something that wasn’t broken?","1"
"163","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great service and vital app but we keep getting the same notification over and over every five minutes. Don’t want to turn it off at the moment but constant pinging drives you nuts...","3"
"164","Hazards Near Me NSW","After giving up on the RFS even updating their iPhone app an update arrives totally unexpected. Has the RFS read the previous user reviews & incorporated improvements into their app? On quick inspection, disappointment. Ok the app at least works but style & information supplied is of a kindergarten grade.","2"
"165","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app is like everything else when it’s needed most eg when there are fires  it crashes yes you still get the notifications but your not able to view on the map to see where the fire is as such people want to know and see","2"
"166","Hazards Near Me NSW","I have iPhone 6 and IOS 12.5.7 When I try to load latest version it says I can load older version as I can’t run IOS13. But tap download and it just gives me download message box again and again and again","2"
"167","Hazards Near Me NSW","App is not updated regularly. App is clunky and difficult to use.  Hazards have been on the map for hours without any update given. This app has taken over from fires near me and it is nowhere near as good. Either employ staff to monitor and update or bring back the fires near me app","1"
"168","Hazards Near Me NSW","Unfortunately though there are too many fires","5"
"169","Hazards Near Me NSW","I was quite happy with fires near me. Now this new ap has replaced it and asked me to set up another watch zone when I already had one. Incident notifications are now less relevant and more complicated to get useful data from. Please reinstate the old app, this one is awful.","1"
"170","Hazards Near Me NSW","I love this app this Fire season, but getting 24 notifications for the same fire in an hour when nothing has changed only increases my anxiety please fix this issue.","3"
"171","Hazards Near Me NSW","I just updated the app as asked and now the app requires me to create an account and use log in details in order to use it. I am absolutely sick of all the services that want login ins and trying to keep up with hundreds of accounts. Just constant data harvesting!!! This is where I depart from “Fires near me”.","1"
"172","Hazards Near Me NSW","It shows the fires and my location on a blank grey background. It won’t load the maps or my watch zones - it keeps saying I have no internet connection even though I do. I’ve just updated to iOS 13.3 so maybe the app needs an update to work with the latest iOS.","1"
"173","Hazards Near Me NSW","Typical official govt app.  Just tells you after the fact about fires around you. What’s the point?  Should tell us before the fact so people can be prepared. Also does not update.  You get old information. A control fire that happened a few days ago will also show on the map.  Never seen a poorer app.","1"
"174","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app is completely hopeless. I have not had one alert for more than five days and there are bushfires everywhere near my watch zone. The maps are haphazard at best and the developer needs to give their money back to the government. Given the importance of an app like this you would not want to rely on it that’s for sure.","1"
"175","Hazards Near Me NSW","I like how the app tells you how big the fire is but I would like to know the current size of the fire as well as the overall state of where is was at the start as well","3"
"176","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app alerts me if i should evacuate or not luckily i have not need to yet but if i ever do i can leave early with this app thanks for making this.","5"
"177","Hazards Near Me NSW","Very little point having this app. Updates are sometimes up to 14 or more hours old. Inaccurate mapping and some complete omissions. We have an active fire just behind us....it was on the map and listed....and now it’s disappeared, but the fire is bigger!","2"
"178","Hazards Near Me NSW","This thing is buggy. Trying to set up a watch zone does not allow you to set a zone size. It’s there, but can’t move the slider. Changing the password leads you in circles. I eventually gave up on it","2"
"179","Hazards Near Me NSW","Please please fix this app. The way it is now is putting peoples lives at risk.  It’s too confusing. Two suggestions:  1. please remove the red flag on the app icon after the incident has been resolved.  2.  Please stop sending me notifications for fires well outside my watch zones.","1"
"180","Hazards Near Me NSW","This Ap is better than other States. Would be good to have wind direction as easy reference in areas of fires (eg visual or click on) and very high risk regions.","5"
"181","Hazards Near Me NSW","No offence to the developers, but I would think this would be obvious; afterall this app was designed to inform people of the dangerous fires around them.","4"
"182","Hazards Near Me NSW","Please could your current location have five kilometre watch zone","5"
"183","Hazards Near Me NSW","COMMUNICATION IS VITAL The fire is 3kms away but tapping on “Gospers” says 60km away! Updated every 12 hours and even then inaccurate or uninformative. The non stop spam of the same message over and over again every FOUR MINUTEs is torture. Recommend ArcGIS Explorer app (go to maps, search bushfires). Updated 2 hourly with Gov sentinel, dea AND fires near me data.","1"
"184","Hazards Near Me NSW","Please roll this update back before we have major fires again and someone dies from the lack of easy to understand warnings. It wasn’t broken - PLEASE undo the fix.","2"
"185","Hazards Near Me NSW","My phone is too old to update the APP  Thank you very much  Same with most other APPS This is ridiculous to do to over 70 yr olds We should not have to update our phones continually. Not only is it too expensive for some people but it’s inconvenient to most of us older citizens. !!","1"
"186","Hazards Near Me NSW","Currently 10 fires in the Kempsey area and when you try to see where the fire is it keeps telling you that the incident has been resolved when it is clearly NOT","2"
"187","Hazards Near Me NSW","As many other reviews are saying - we had a very useful fire warning App.  The update has made it basically USELESS.  Way too complicated.  PLEASE go back to the previous important advice app. I’m dumping this one - will hope to get fire info from local radio.","1"
"188","Hazards Near Me NSW","To start off with it was great knowing where the fires were around. But after receiving the same notification time after time & going to the map & see it hadn’t changed, it was very confusing & frustrating.","2"
"189","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app is so great for letting me know what’s nearby, although, I keep getting numerous notifications for the same thing many many times","4"
"190","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app has kept us as informed as we could be. Very accurate.","5"
"191","Hazards Near Me NSW","This update is awful. I can only sort by recently added or by alert level. I'm unable to sort by hazards NEAR ME which is kinda important. I don't care for what is happening 700km away. I want to quickly and easily see what is happening near me.","1"
"192","Hazards Near Me NSW","After you’ve seen the incident and read it, the notification icon doesn’t go away.","2"
"193","Hazards Near Me NSW","I’ve received a message today that the developers are now aware of the duplicate messages I’ve been getting for ages. Today I’ve been getting duplicate messages every 5 minutes. Please fix this ASAP or I and probably thousands more will delete the app.","1"
"194","Hazards Near Me NSW","Since the new update this is the worst thing I have ever seen can’t get rid of notifications even days later the old story is why fix something that isn’t broken good bye from me I’ll get the other app","1"
"195","Hazards Near Me NSW","In a safety environment, accuracy is everything. I advise anyone using this app to speak to your local firefighting service and not rely on this for accurate information, as it is rather delayed.  It does however give a nice broad indication of fires.","2"
"196","Hazards Near Me NSW","Why would the rural fire service have an app that will not work on older iPhones. Previously worked but no longer updates  Suppose you can only be safe if you have the money to replace your phone","1"
"197","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app you cannot use when in dark mode when in list view you can’t see any of the text or when in the settings page. It’s useless when in dark mode. Please fix this as fire season has already started.","1"
"198","Hazards Near Me NSW","It was working until a couple of days ago. Now I get a notification but can’t get any info on the incident. Stuck on the first screen of the app. This app has promise but a long way to go before it works as well as Fires Near Me","1"
"199","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app but I have upgraded to the iPhone X and now it doesn’t work so... Needs iPhone X support. It would be much appreciated","5"
"200","Hazards Near Me NSW","The latest update is suddenly iPhone orientation (I.e. portrait) only.  What’s happened to iPad landscape orientation?  You’ve ruined an ok app.  A new update is just out.  It’s still in portrait orientation on my iPad.  Come on guys ... the Australia-wide version does landscape on my pad, so it’s clearly easy to do.  Fix the NSW version, please.","1"
"201","Hazards Near Me NSW","Can often take days for incidents to be updated","3"
"202","Hazards Near Me NSW","For users with software versions older that IOS 13: Please fix the download older version function as it’s NOT working! Have tried multiple times without success. This is an important app for EVERYONE!","1"
"203","Hazards Near Me NSW","It’s good to include other hazzards, but in an emergency, if you want to check what’s happening, this app is too hard to use. At the moment there is a notification coming up, but I can’t work out how to see what it’s for","1"
"204","Hazards Near Me NSW","Please include current and forecast wind direction. A major piece of information that informs decision making about when to prepare to leave.","4"
"205","Hazards Near Me NSW","Easier to navigate, key information is clearly presented","5"
"206","Hazards Near Me NSW","This App doesn’t work a lot of the time stating no internet connection. This includes when I am connected to wifi and have other apps working. Bring back fires near me as it always worked.","1"
"207","Hazards Near Me NSW","Put screen rotation back in the app to assist accessibility for people with special needs.  Some accessibility support settings work better in landscape view.","3"
"208","Hazards Near Me NSW","A 3 years old review requesting updated reviews during disasters. Really?","4"
"209","Hazards Near Me NSW","Do you mean no one in control, meaning fire unattended or blazing out of control? I don’t see either, misleading information to the community!","3"
"210","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app showing we’re the hazards but would be great to have an app for Apple Watch like the Vic emergency app.","4"
"211","Hazards Near Me NSW","I had to delete and re in put the app. It was coming up blank. Now I can’t get it on the screen again. Is there a command that enables me to do that in App Store or on the app itself?","2"
"212","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is A Pretty Cool App But I feel like You can just go on news and it should tell you the same thing","4"
"213","Hazards Near Me NSW","Like previous reviewers stated, we need to see alerts in our home zones, not 300km away. No option of sorting list by location/closest etc or filtering out what we don’t want to see.","1"
"214","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app worked fine then some moron tried to update it to include flood information and they completely broke the app. Surely the NSW government can afford to pay at least a half qualified software developer.","1"
"215","Hazards Near Me NSW","The Vic app is way better than this one. Vic app gives you notification before nsw. Nsw doesn’t let you know other emergencies apart from fires.","2"
"216","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app.  We appreciate your efforts at keeping NSW updated.  Only wish that the fires near me Australia was half as good.","5"
"217","Hazards Near Me NSW","Would love to be able to use it however when I’m either connected to my home wifi or cellular data out and about the app keeps telling me no internet connection. Frustrating with what’s going on.","1"
"218","Hazards Near Me NSW","The app is totally inaccurate. We got burnt out on New Years Eve. 2 neighbours lost their houses and yet we are not shown in the impact zone. We only live 8 km from where the fire started. The Vic Emergency app is a lot better. It even shows last nights back burns. Do something!","1"
"219","Hazards Near Me NSW","Can no longer just open the map to see what is happening around you, and click on incidents to see what they are.  Useless!","1"
"220","Hazards Near Me NSW","Details are slow to update. You need to be able to sort by distance from your location.","1"
"221","Hazards Near Me NSW","I don’t want to see the whole area that’s been burnt so far. I need to see where the flames currently are.","3"
"222","Hazards Near Me NSW","No idea how to control the alerts There’s no point to the additional info Very risky if you were relying on bushfire advice like the old app Full of junk alerts","1"
"223","Hazards Near Me NSW","Not everyone can afford a new iPad. This app only works in iOS13+  so useless for anyone unable to upgrade past iOS12. Our taxes are being used to produce this app so you should support earlier iOS versions.","1"
"224","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app is only fair it won’t show watch zone on the map like the Fires Near Me app without Floods . I live on a farm & rely on good Fire information","3"
"225","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app, but I would appreciate being able to adjust the size of a watch zone.","4"
"226","Hazards Near Me NSW","Since the app updated a few days ago I keep getting asked to set my zone & have trouble finding any alerts for the zones set. Very user unfriendly!  I have deleted it off my phone.","1"
"227","Hazards Near Me NSW","Latest update means extra clicks.  Opens every time asking me to add a watch list on home page when I already have them.   Look at the watch zone and 2/3 of the page is the option buttons. The map is 1/3 of the page.   Get rid of the buttons after I set it up ! Did anyone even user test this????","2"
"228","Hazards Near Me NSW","Disappointed that I can no longer search for a location. Makes the app useless when I'm away from home.","2"
"229","Hazards Near Me NSW","Very useful info. Thanks.","4"
"230","Hazards Near Me NSW","Seriously considering deleting this app. Too many hazard warnings quickly turning in to “Incident Resolved “. I really miss the Fires Near Me app. It was simple, relevant and didn’t over cook the threat unless really serious.","1"
"231","Hazards Near Me NSW","The new version requires iOS 13 or above. My older iPads no longer can use it and the “download last compatible version” doesn’t work. So now I am cut off. That’s hopeless.","1"
"232","Hazards Near Me NSW","Keeps asking to create watchzone. No way to see list by items closest to me","2"
"233","Hazards Near Me NSW","App would be alright if it it actually worked instead of saying check my internet connection when clearly I have a connection","2"
"234","Hazards Near Me NSW","Since this app got changed from the excellent fires near me I often see fires and nothing in the app. I’m next to a big one at the moment which I know is back burn but nothing.","1"
"235","Hazards Near Me NSW","The App only works if your phone is one of the latest models. There should be a way to install it without having a brand new phone","1"
"236","Hazards Near Me NSW","Don’t upgrade to this version no push notifications not as good as previous version.","2"
"237","Hazards Near Me NSW","Hi,  Great App. One suggestion is it possible to layer the wind direction or weather onto the map?","5"
"238","Hazards Near Me NSW","Big pity that I can’t still use the old version on my old phone... now no access to this important info.","1"
"239","Hazards Near Me NSW","I have fires in my watch zone, one says out of control. I have not received an alert as I thought I should.","2"
"240","Hazards Near Me NSW","Terrible! It no longer works on older phones. I relied on the old app during the bushfires near my home. Now I can’t access the alerts. I’m upset about this.","1"
"241","Hazards Near Me NSW","Alert notification badge not clearing.","3"
"242","Hazards Near Me NSW","‘Fires near me’ was great.  However it’s now broken since the update to ‘Hazards near me’ and isn’t working at all.  App keeps loading & doesn’t show results. It’s stuffed.","1"
"243","Hazards Near Me NSW","I even uninstalled and reinstalled and there’s still no ability to add a watch zone. It says the app is only for incidents in NSW, my home address and the watch zone I’m trying to set up is definitely in NSW, I’m in the outer suburbs of Sydney.","1"
"244","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app constantly fails to update. Unsure whether it’s not being updated or if it’s just full of bugs. Don’t rely on this as a definitive source of information","1"
"245","Hazards Near Me NSW","The App only seems to work for me when I’m connected to wifi. When I’m connected to 4g, I keep getting a no connection error.","2"
"246","Hazards Near Me NSW","The app has stopped working after updating to iOS 17. You need to update the app. When it works it’s great. This problem had occurred for me on an iPhone 12 and iPhone SE.","1"
"247","Hazards Near Me NSW","The App is often plagued by “server error”.  It is hard to stay informed when the recommended app seems to be down most of the time!","1"
"248","Hazards Near Me NSW","Tried to set up watch zones for my friends houses and got an error message: “Fires Near Me NSW only provides notifications for incidents in NSW” All of my friends lIve in NSW. Whoever created this app please be aware of this and fix this bug quickly please.","1"
"249","Hazards Near Me NSW","Really good idea but for 20 cents more you could have gone all the way, and had a map that handles well.  Keep working on integrating your overlay map with the google map and it will be heaps better.","1"
"250","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app doesn't get updated often enough it should be updated hourly at the least, last update was 6pm yesterday","2"
"251","Hazards Near Me NSW","Need to allow app to use location service on iPhone","1"
"252","Hazards Near Me NSW","Upgraded from fires near me today.  Bad move! Now I am being drowned in cross border incidents that are irrelevant to me and I can’t see any way to eliminate them.","1"
"253","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great for warnings but not good for concerned evacuated home owners. Causes much distress over safety of their homes. Can imply their community is wiped out through greyed out areas on map. Needs more specific explanations of greyed out areas.","2"
"254","Hazards Near Me NSW","App keeps coming up with error when I try and enter my address or even the school address. Consistently unavailable 🥺","2"
"255","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app but it needs tweaking to be more accurate and updated.","3"
"256","Hazards Near Me NSW","Unreliable for personal safety and potentially life threatening in recent 2020 fires for many people. I don’t know if the networks were jammed or or the app was broken, but we had to rely on looking out a window for a true assessment of FIRES NEAR ME.","1"

"273","Hazards Near Me NSW","This “hazards” update much less intuitive than the fire’s near me app. Over complicated.","1"
"274","Hazards Near Me NSW","Causing a lot of panic during nsw fires. Needs colour coded thermal info to indicate current, past activity so you can see direction of fire front. (sentinel hotspots) Distance info is grossly inaccurate putting lives at risk","1"
"275","Hazards Near Me NSW","I keep getting system failed errors Plus, this app misses a lot of fires!!  Can the RFS not update this as they update the website??

"314","Hazards Near Me NSW","FIRES NEAR ME APP REVIEW  What has happened to this app?!?  I’m all for merging of warnings - fires, floods & incidents - but not at the cost of a smooth & previously well-functioning app!  I’ve just gone to use the app & installed the recent update - feb 2023 - & it’s is not letting me sign in unless I go thru a govt agency & is requiring my location services to be permanently switched on.  ‘Please ensure the app has access to your location’  I’ve previously been able to use this app for years without having to have location services switched on. I live in remote area & to leave location services switched on, would drain every ounce of power from my device.   ‘This allows the app & website to share information about you’  What information do you need? What I need is a reliable, functioning app that notifies me when there is potential hazards in my set watch areas.   Other feedback would include being able to access the specific area on the map in the ‘notifications’ list. This would give a broader sense of where the incident is - especially for regional areas.   Also, when selecting a recent incident on the notifications list , although it’s showing ‘this incident is now resolved’ it remains on the list.   These are just a few things I’ve noticed upon opening the app just now.   I trust - for everyone’s sake - hiccups, glitches & clunky interface malfunctions are sorted asap & before the next fire - or flood - season.   Thanks to the developers for making this app accessible. Please continue to refine it for the safety of everyone who uses & relies on it.   Black Summer Bushfire Survivor  Djiringanj Country","3"
"315","Hazards Near Me NSW","If you could receive an alert from the app that lets you know if a fire is in the vicinity of a fixed location i.e. your home, also if it could tell you in that fixed location what the fire rating is for the day and perhaps the next few days so you could plan ahead and leave early if it is catastrophic.","3"
"316","Hazards Near Me NSW","Fire is everywhere but in the app says all controled , lies","1"
"317","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is a good start. Some suggestions for improvement include. -use a map that is similar to the Victorian app map with contours and minor roads. -descriptions have been the same for all warning levels and descriptions have not been updated regularly.  -it is not useful to tell people to stay out of the path of fire or to know what to do as a specific fire message for a town. This should be a general message not specific message. More detail for towns is required when they are under threat. -For a large fire have different sections as the fire may be behaving differently in different areas, meaning that one area may be emergency warning but another may be watch and act this advice will differ. -remember residents who stay to fight are using this information to be informed and make life changing decisions like when to leave, so be more specific and update text specifically more often. -use the Vic emergency app and take the learnings to make it better, work together as states as this is app could result in lives being saved or lost and the current needs massive improvements. There is an app in Vic learn from it! Use the good bits from Vic and NSW app to make it better. -fire maps should continue into neighboring states rather than cut off as if the other half of the fire doesn’t exist! Go at least 2hours over the state border. -change from NSW fire to NSW emergency so you can put fallen trees, road closures, floods and other emergency warnings. Keep up the good work and make it better!","2"
"318","Hazards Near Me NSW","ahahhahaahah","1"
"319","Hazards Near Me NSW","I have an iPad3 which cannot use iOS10 or 11 so this app is now useless and NSWRFS tells me that Apple have forced this move and that they were not allowed to make an app that is  also compatible with earlier operating systems! This leaves me in the dangerous position of having no app in the middle of bushfire season! I am about to be away from the property on holiday so now I have to check on the very poor NSWRFS website which does not work well on the ipad and doesn't send alerts. I am disgusted with Apple if they are making app developers drop compatibility with earlier OSs.  That would mean I'd have to buy a new iPad at great expense when my old one works perfectly well (except with iOS10/11 only apps) and is only 4 years old. Apple you are outrageous and having been brand loyal for many years I am now going to boycott future products until you stop this cynical built-in obsolescence. The NSWRFS webmaster's only suggestion was to buy a new iPad. Thanks, I'll take it out of my pension. Yeah, right.","1"
"320","Hazards Near Me NSW","Needs a link to open the RFS website. The app should list fires that are near me at the top of the list. Navigating between the list and the map is a bit frustrating. The app only has portrait view the picture you use in the App Store shows landscape view. On an iPad landscape would make it easier to navigate the map.","4"
"321","Hazards Near Me NSW","Guess we can hope no news is good news.  Last update was at 9:30pm as its now 10:15am and wind is picking up it would be nice to have a more current update on the fire 30ks away especially as we have family closer to it than us.   More regular updates or even an idea when to expect the next update would be good.   Other than that think its a great, easy to use app so thanks!","3"
"322","Hazards Near Me NSW","Good basic features but needs more. I work in Sydney but live on the central coast 70km away. It would be good to have push notification telling me there is a fire near my house and not just where I am. I don't want to have to keep checking the app to see if my house is safe or whether I can even get home because the F3 is shut down.","3"
"323","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app, that covers all the features of other free ones out on the market, from the source.  Would be nice to have Hazard Reduction information included so I could browse HR's in my area, so I know what is putting up smoke, but otherwise can't fault it!","5"
"324","Hazards Near Me NSW","Living in the bush I find this app extremely handy although 2 days ago it showed there was a bushfire 4km from our home so we went to investigate (as you do) and found out it would have been closer to 30km away. As long as your happy with a generalised area and not a deadly accurate area than you will love this app.","4"
"325","Hazards Near Me NSW","Works perfectly on my iPhone 4. It's a great app with much useful info. I travel a lot in NSW so it's good to see stuff many kilometers from where I am as I may travel in that direction. I am an RFS volunteer so it's of even more interest what's happening at home whilst I am away.","5"
"326","Hazards Near Me NSW","Think its great, no more waiting on the radio/tv for incorrect updates. but has bugs. Side list won't disappear and can't get full screen map. Needs link to RFS would love to see a freeze frame eg: how far/ fast and predictions of travelling fire, winds. Something like weather apps.","5"
"327","Hazards Near Me NSW","It's okay for information, but have found Facebook pages (non-NSW Fire) know of fires far quicker than the app.   Thought it was one for people to use, especially in Summer, re fire dangers and emergencies.  Can't rely on this as a fire warning system in Prone areas.","3"
"328","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is helping out a lot, I would recomend getting it as we are now prepared with our animals ready to leave as well as things of sentimental value, however it would be nice to have it give alerts about when to leave.","5"
"329","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app but being a wife of a rfs volunteer i use this also to check on the conditions of the fire however status of fires are updated slow. There was one he went to the other day that was updated 6 hours later. Can we try get an hourly update?","4"
"330","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is excellent! But would love the feature of current fire ban levels for each area and also push notifications for when there is a newly listed fire within my fire near me within 50km.","4"
"331","Hazards Near Me NSW","This WAS a great app, but since older devices like mine cannot use the app nor can I access the newer update this app is now useless. Developers need to keep in mind not all of us can afford the newer devices and an earlier version should be still be available particularly during bushfires season. Supposedly to warn and save lives but now redundant! Very disappointed!","2"
"332","Hazards Near Me NSW","With the current fire situation in naw (oct 2013) this app has been my life line to what's happening in the region my husband is currently firefighting. Thanks for the reliable peace of mind rather than news reports on what's 'spectacular' only!","5"
"333","Hazards Near Me NSW","Fantastic app thank you, however map detail re town placement needs checking. ie Kiama is no where near the correct position. This could be dangerous if used by people who do not know the area.","5"
"334","Hazards Near Me NSW","Like this app, until the update and it is stuck on portrait view, which might be ok for iphone users, bad for ipad, cant get much of a view now, the side bar seems to be stuck on blocking half the screen","4"
"335","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app for getting incident info and correlating with maps. As others have said, needs: - saved home location - push notifications for fires within 50km of home and current location - possible integration with incident streams from FRNSW, SES - ability to tag incidents as of interest so push notifications received on change of status  Thanks for the effort taken to develop","4"
"336","Hazards Near Me NSW","I've used this for two seasons. It actually posts new fires quickly eg 30min. But the flag stays there for weeks after the fire is no longer a threat. And without push notification... Well my place might be smoke by the time I look. I back onto bush so on scary days, I'm opening the app hourly.","3"
"337","Hazards Near Me NSW","There is nothing more annoying than an app that constantly uses your GPS - even when not running.","4"
"338","Hazards Near Me NSW","Thank you for a very good app! This is a pivotal part of the information sharing service which will help save lives. Please, please tender to make this platform nation wide! And thank you all at the RFS for the brave work you are doing right now. God bless.","4"
"339","Hazards Near Me NSW","Would like to see the date and time of the incident, also to see planned and actual hr operation would be great. Otherwise a great app , thank you","5"
"340","Hazards Near Me NSW","Yes, I want to know if there are fires nearby. I do not need to know every second of the day wherever I happen to be that second. Stupid decision to insist on having location services on always when there are better options, such as on while using the app. It has taken me weeks to find out this was why the GPS was active all the time.","1"
"341","Hazards Near Me NSW","Not a great move, pulling the plug on this version of the app just this afternoon, at the START of the season, when so many people are still using iOS 9. If you don't have iOS10 for whatever reason, you can't use the new version 3.0 of this app. Stupid timing.","3"
"342","Hazards Near Me NSW","There are two Fires Near Me apps which can cause confusion, because the NSW version does not include ACT fires, while the other version does. Why after many years has this confusion been allowed to remain? If I use an app called Fires Near Me, I expect it would show a bushfire 6km away, but it does not because it is not in NSW. Please take this version offline or clearly state its shortcomings.","1"
"343","Hazards Near Me NSW","It did help me get some photos of a fire near me, however that fire has been out for 4 days at the time of writing and still shows up in the app. It NEEDS more frequent fire updates, this is NOT reliable for someone in a dangerous fire situation that needs constant updates on a fire's status.","2"
"344","Hazards Near Me NSW","It works pretty well but obviously there are some things they dont really want us to read, the use of grey text on a dark yellow background is a choice I do not understand unless they are trying to hide what is written!","3"
"345","Hazards Near Me NSW","Thank you for making this app, it has helped us plan and figure out no-go zones for our holiday, and the information is very useful :)","5"
"346","Hazards Near Me NSW","Needs an update for 4inch iPhones. If possible to have push notifications for out of control fires within 50km would be great.","5"
"347","Hazards Near Me NSW","Would be good to be able to set up push alerts for fires near set locations - would mean that those of us in high risk areas wouldn't need to continually check the app in summer. Otherwise, great app, thanks!","4"
"348","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app but really needs push notifications when fires break out within a certain distance (configurable) to your current location... That would be perfect!","4"
"349","Hazards Near Me NSW","Update is okay though it removes the quick link(blue button) to each fires details when clicking on that fire, You must go to the Fires list to view further fire details.  No longer shows mini map of fire and you must zoom in to general map to get an idea of the fires area.  App crashes when pressing on 'Fires within 50km' tab.  Still no push alerts based on location or district FDI ratings.","4"
"350","Hazards Near Me NSW","The TOBAN advice is out of date and out of location. For an app that represents NSWRFS fire danger information this is a bit lame. Other than that [although given the import of a TOBAN that is a pretty important flaw] it's a moderately OK app. The alternative app that does the same thing is OK too.","3"
"351","Hazards Near Me NSW","Yes the maps need adjustment, yes push notifications would be great but congrats to the RFS for a fantastic resource that is easily accessible at all times.","5"
"352","Hazards Near Me NSW","Needs more info added like how many resources are in attendance possibly a fire map as well of area burnt like on the my RFS web site","4"
"353","Hazards Near Me NSW","iPhone 3Gs with iOS4 running and the app starts but just sits on the main screen apparently updating but never going anywhere.  Have had the app sitting there for over 15 mins and all I get is the updating icon showing in the middle of the screen.  Sounds like a great app, would be better if it worked !","1"
"354","Hazards Near Me NSW","It's a great handy app and I don't know why people are complaining. Some icons are blue big whoop it's a very useful app and it can save lives..","5"
"355","Hazards Near Me NSW","Needs push alerts ASAP. Needs map to be fixed ASAP as some towns are not in the correct location.","4"
"356","Hazards Near Me NSW","Simple and informative. Get it and keep up to date what's happening around you.","5"
"357","Hazards Near Me NSW","Very basic. Only shows fires roughly where they are. If this was more like the Country fire authority's app the community and firefighters would have a very useful tool at their disposal. Think it might be time to upgrade this app","3"
"358","Hazards Near Me NSW","Why make fire icons blue - the same colour as Google map road route icons? A poor design decision on an otherwise useful app.","5"
"359","Hazards Near Me NSW","The app should be an excellent contribution to fire safety once a few wrinkles are sorted out. It currently hogs location services when backgrounded, which will drain your battery.","3"
"360","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app is a great idea, hoever since the RFS are too lazy? or incompetant? to ever update the data in it is worse than useless it is dangerous and stress causing.  I mean WHAT ISTHE POINT IN THIS APP when there's a fire burning a couple of km away, the fire weather is classified as CATASTROPHIC and they only upate the fire status every 17 or 18 hours.  Great idea guys but when the data is HALF a DAY behind ABC news 24 the WT* is the point?  On the weekend we had a fire that was listed as ADVICE while they had a DC10, the AVRO RJ and a couple of helicopters water bombing it.  ?????  It seems that that fire was a little beyond the ADVICE point.","1"
"361","Hazards Near Me NSW","Would love push options. Also the ability to register Addresses ie House etc and get notified if a fire near listed addresses","3"
"362","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is a very good app, but would be good if it could display 1) current fire ban level, and 2) use push notifications for fires within 50km","4"
"363","Hazards Near Me NSW","Only has option for location services always or never , need to ad 'whilst utilising app' otherwise location services always on chews too much battery","2"
"364","Hazards Near Me NSW","The fire distance seems to be right but mapping is completely off my current location is approx 35km south east of where it says I am. And updates are not correct or not updated when the fire is out.","2"
"365","Hazards Near Me NSW","Live updates on current fire situation. Information is easily accessible.","5"
"366","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app even tells you if a fire is under control or not. Very handy.","5"

"372","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great app. Would be more accurate with google maps. Apple maps do not work well in Australia.","4"
"373","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app is slower on my iPhone 7 Plus phone compared to my iPhone 4S. The last update was 2014. I think a long awaited update is due UPDATE SOON!","3"
"374","Hazards Near Me NSW","At least the google maps part of it still works.  It even tells you where you are. Would have given it more stars if it told you where the fires were.","2"
"375","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is a fantastic app, immediately eliminates sorting out other news reports for fires not relevant to you","5"

"379","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great amazing app. Always updates were fires are at. Even showed there was one at toys r us westfields yesterday","5"
"380","Hazards Near Me NSW","I had used this for a while but after upgrading to IOS 4.2 beta it has stopped at the first opening screen image with the wait clock on and nothing happening!!  Please fix :)","1"
"381","Hazards Near Me NSW","Upgrade should be considered to include the fire ban levels within 50km of current location","3"
"382","Hazards Near Me NSW","The app is good for actual incidents. It would be nice to be able to check the local Fire Danger Rating for Potential risks.","4"
"383","Hazards Near Me NSW","Really good solid app, simple and effective.   A future version with notifications for nearby incidents would be a great addition.   As a fireman, I just wish the NSWFB would make an app like this too!!  Also I think the Icons colour depends on the incident type (advice is blue on the RFS website etc).","4"
"384","Hazards Near Me NSW","Great and simple app. Shame you didn't do the Victorian version.","5"
"385","Hazards Near Me NSW","Lots of potential but let down badly by flawed foundation map data. Two examples - Yass and Goulburn are marked in different locations to where they really are, many kms away.","2"
"386","Hazards Near Me NSW","I tried to use this app but found the Emergency AUS app better because I can setup a watch area around my place so I get notified when something is happening","2"

"437","Hazards Near Me NSW","This is an absolute disaster. I am an 80 year old resident in a fire prone area and my iPad will not support this app and it’s predecessor which I relied on in 2019/20 fires. no longer works so I am left without any information. This needs immediate rectification.","1"
"438","Hazards Near Me NSW","Fires near me was useful.Now we are informed of every car fire, structure fire etc. For those of us concerned about bushfires only, this is annoying and intrusive. Definitely a bad move.","1"
"439","Hazards Near Me NSW","I was happy with the original app.after nominating our local area, plus areas close to our adult children, two of whom live in regions that have experienced bushfires over recent years. The notifications worked well, although sometimes a bit out of date. However, with this new emergency app, when I tried to enter the areas I wanted notifications for, it didn’t work & I just see a general list, including places hundreds of kilometres away. After having difficulties updating it on my phone, I’m reluctant to change it on my ipad!  Can I also suggest the listed incidents clearly indicate where these places are - there are hundreds of small towns, villages etc., (especially in the regional areas) & many of those names are unrecognisable to anyone not living nearby. Why are you showing reviews from 3 yrs. ago that have no relevance to this new (supposedly improved) app? PLEASE make it easier to use & able to be accessed on phones & ipads that aren’t just the latest model. It’s a great disappointment & will not help a lot of people in its present form. Reading other reviews, most people are unhappy with the change. Your tech people need to take notice of the numerous complaints & fix it.","1"
"440","Hazards Near Me NSW","I got rid of it and went to ‘fires near me australia.’ At least it operates easily and I can still put my watch zone in.This works just like the old app that was fires near me nsw. The hazards near me was horrible to use, kept dropping pins all over the place, couldn’t get rid of old notifications, was difficult to open the info on the fire. Honestly, a waste of time. I hope the fires near me australia doesn’t do this.","1"
"441","Hazards Near Me NSW","When you have a fire consuming 400000 ha the warnings are useless. I’m currently getting one every 5 minutes with no useful information. The app needs a news feed where the most current news on the fire is right there at the top. The maps also need to show where the active fire is as well as what has burnt.

"442","Hazards Near Me NSW","My zones notification includes areas outside by up to 600 ks away even though I have it set to 50 ks, also the notification bubble on iOS leaves you to search through warning after warning ( even after refreshing, it’s not there) to clear then suddenly the notification appears at the top of list maybe soon as app is opened it should be first thing on screen that opens up.Example this morning opened up refreshed brought up “fire under control” hundreds of ks away, then refreshed again and there it is the relevant notification within my zone setting.If you don’t persevere you won’t see the notification that relates to your area warning.Let the end user search for warnings further away if they want rather than just listing them with no relevance.","2"
"443","Hazards Near Me NSW","Downloaded this app for my area, Tullakool NSW, but can’t add a watch zone. Apparently Tullakool, NSW is not in NSW. The app tells me it can not add a watch zone as it is only for watch zones in NSW. WTF.","1"
"444","Hazards Near Me NSW","This app is head and shoulders in front of the firewatch offerings from other Australian states so the NSW RFS and this app’s developers are to be congratulated.  Another reviewer has suggested adding the ability to replay events as they change (akin to BoM radar - probably every 12 hours over the last 5 days = 10 frames would be sufficient). I support that request.  I’d like to add:  1. At least on the iPad, support landscape mode. Forcing to portrait mode is quite unhelpful. By all means add a control for users who want to force “always portrait” but please give some thought to those users who would prefer landscape maps.  2. Give the user the option of (a) always resetting to “current location” - which is the only option offered at the moment, (b) preserving the most recent central point and zoom factor, and (c) a rectangle that just encloses the user’s current watch zones.  Most of the time I would leave mine on “b”. Combined with a “replay” feature, this would give the user a reasonable means of judging direction and speed.","4"
"445","Hazards Near Me NSW","After an alarm glitch before Xmas, which was finally rectified, the app works well. However all too often entire fires up to 500,000 ha in size, will go missing and won’t display for hours. Also, the fires of 2019/20 have become ridiculously large so the warning levels can become hard to follow, with an emergency level for a fire 3kms away really only applicable 70kms away. Hopefully the app can be reworked to highlight active fire areas within each fire zone - the Gospers Fire is a perfect example, over 500,000 ha in size but active fires can be a very very long way from us.","4"
"446","Hazards Near Me NSW","Could the app include road closures around affected areas ( fire zones)  ,this would give the app an overall coverage so you could see the fire zone and roads closed in that area.   The Whereis map has road closures but does not have the fires. So I was flicking between the 2 apps.  Great app, used when recently camping and for general travel, good to know what going on in your immediate area.Helped us greatly to get out of the affected areas.","4"

"1","Get Prepared","This app is a great idea and has really good content and information but I found it to clunky to use especially as someone with a disability. I just wanted to give some constructive feedback to help improve it :)  The medication section was very limited in it’s entry, I have lots of different types of medication and dosages in both ml and g, not just 1 “pill”. It also was hard to add in individual conditions, I could see them duplicate when I edited the title/condition but couldn’t delete the incorrect ones.  Sections such as Response Capacity only had a small text box to type into, make it hard to review what was written.  Adding Contacts was a bit difficult as sometimes it wouldn’t confirm with the “done” button, and in terms of UI, having the Select From Contacts bottom at the button instead of the top was a bit confusing for me.  I got a bit frustrated and didn’t finish to the export stage so not sure how looks but I think it’s a really good feature.","3"
"2","Get Prepared","This app does help in reminding me of what I need to do to prepare for an emergency, however…….. it doesn’t display properly on my iPhone, so once I’ve finished entering information the “done” tab is missing or is under other text, and if you use the back button you lose the information you’ve entered.  Also, if I have more than one device it doesn’t appear to share across devices, so I have to enter it twice.  Is this right or am I missing something?","3"

"5","Get Prepared","Setting my different contacts for the different types of support I might need was a really useful exercise. And it’s great to know I can text them all at once if I ever need straight from the app. Can’t wait to see what features get added in the future!","5"

"8","Get Prepared","The app is impossible to use with dark mode on.   Additionally, it does not support large text sizes (which is crucial if you need glasses to read).

"1","AirRater","This is a great app particularly with the bushfires in many parts of Australia. I have a couple of minor improvement suggestions: * ability to change the order of locations when you’ve added more than one * display of the currency of the data for each location i.e. when the sensor last updated it’s reading or when the app last retrieved the reading from the sensor, which ever is older (this could perhaps be configurable so those that aren’t interested in this information can disable it being displayed) * inclusion of a lock screen widget so you don’t have to unlock your phone and open the app to display the current value and rating of your chosen sensor(s) in your chosen location(s)","4"
"2","AirRater","This is a very helpful app with good quality, reliable data. It has been especially useful during bushfire season as the air quality changes quickly.   A few small suggestions for improvements:  1. It would be good to know the time and location of the reading that is displayed. For example, the air quality might be getting noticeably worse but the app shows a reading that seems ok. If we could see that it was an old reading that would be helpful.   2. The graph is also really useful but a bit hard to access. Perhaps add a link on the main menu at the bottom for easier access?   3. there are a few bugs to iron out. For example, sometimes it seems to reset and I have to re-register. Also, the onscreen keyboard gets hidden when trying to type the name of a location to save (iPhone 11 iOS 13).  4.  Overall there could be some other general UI improvements to make it a bit sleeker. There are other apps in the App Store that are much easier on the eye but don’t have the same quality reliable data that’s locally sourced. Perhaps you could borrow some UI ideas from those apps? In the same vein I think you could come up with a better app icon!  Thanks again for a great app.","5"
"3","AirRater","Great app, even better if there would be updates every day (around the same time) and an indication of when the samples are taken. Plenty of detail hidden in the app, impressive, the labels of what information is available could be clearer. Agree with other people that it would be great to be able to change the order of chosen locations. Nothing else compares with the detail and quality of the information.","4"
"4","AirRater","It is a great app as it helps me know what is happening re pollen in my suburb in Canberra. When I start sneezing I just feel helpless but with this app, i wonder now if there are more than one kind of trigger, including stress.  A second review: I am living in Sydney at the moment and find your app invaluable, even tho it doesn’t tell me about pollen like it does in Canberra. I now take my medication when I get the symptoms and they align with the levels you post. And that’s a great comfort in this dreadful and scary time of galloping Delta strain here.  So thank you again.","5"
"5","AirRater","Great app, works well with very useful information..seems to be updated and fairly accurate (I watched smoke drift over and soon after the pollution count rose). Only complaint I have is I can’t seem to reset the location...I keep having to type in a new search instead of it just going to my current location. This may be a user issue. Otherwise very useful. 👍","4"
"6","AirRater","Canberra has had a lot of smoke from the recent bushfires and I’ve been using this app to help me decide which days I can walk to work. I like that this app uses the most up to date PM2.5 data available (hourly averages of the readings taken every 5 mins at each monitoring station). The app is also easy to use. Even better, I sent the administrators a question and got a response within the hour!","5"
"7","AirRater","The data it shows is great, I’m trying to track pollen levels especially & it’s fabulous having them all listed separately.  But, it only updates once a day, sometimes not at all.  It’s 7pm here, and it was last updated “a day ago”, which I know was sometime mid-morning yesterday. I had no symptoms yesterday morning, but by evening my asthma was severe. This evening I have symptoms but again, but hasn’t been updated for close to 36 hours.  It needs to be at least twice a day, preferably 3 or 4 times daily to be of use.  Also, there’s 1 monitoring station in southern Tasmania, 1 in the north, & 1 in the ACT - what’s the point of setting your location any more specifically than your city when all the data comes from 1  place? So much potential but needs better monitoring to be really useful.","3"
"8","AirRater","I appreciate this app so much. I like being able to set locations, and to know whether to take precautions when I venture outside. The simple interface is great to be able to see the current pollen situation quickly at a glance especially when it’s often been in the extreme category lately. Thank you for your efforts!","5"
"9","AirRater","I have had this app for 6 days now. I am already getting an idea of how it will help me to manage allergies without having to rely on drugs or seclusion. I'm impressed with the various pollen data graphs. It's still a bit clunky to use but I will stick with it to help with the research as well as to learn my triggers. I live the alarms when there is high particulate count!","4"
"10","AirRater","Installed and chose not to register - I just wanted so see the maps of pollen etc. when I had accepted EULA app took me to map page but none of the 3 data sets pollen etc were available so the map was empty.   I assume I have to register or provide personal details or something but it appears the app can not be used passively to monitor env quality without registering and sharing personal data.  Or I just can't get it to work...  Re-downloaded to try again    No joy.  Have screen grab of map to show what I am seeing.  Will send to dev","1"
"11","AirRater","This app has been invaluable.  We use it every day, checking air quality often.  In Canberra we’ve had variable air quality for weeks and this app has enabled us to monitor when air quality is favourable and when we have to close ourselves off from the outside.","5"
"12","AirRater","This is a really excellent app fir the locations it devices. Love both the pollen count and airquality features and the ability to set home, work and other locations. Been using it for over a year and am impressed with its reliability. Interface is good too.","5"
"13","AirRater","Given the known health impacts of poor air quality - e.g. research published in the MJA has shown that people died in Sydney as a result of the 2016 hazard reduction burn offs - so an app like this is incredibly important.   Unfortunately this app is hindered by the NSW government who is deliberately withholding the publication and communication of hourly particulate matter (PM)  counts despite having been warned about this by Asthma Australia and health experts.   This app does help but needs the more accurate data from the NSW government.   Improvements: the user interface needs more work to make it polished and a better experience. Also, the text is sometimes so small that it’s difficult to read. Please make all text larger.","3"
"14","AirRater","The problem with this app is it is too slow to update. So if you are in a stable air situation it is good. I am not. I had a huge amount of bushfire smoke blow in about an hour ago and the rating is still good (it should be hazardous as I am inside with wet towels under the door and breathing is hard, the house is full of smoke). This has happened two other times when the smoke had blown in. So for my purposes in our current situation the app does not do what I need it to do","2"
"15","AirRater","I have downloaded the app due to the smokey conditions in CANBERRA during the bushfires. I especially like the descriptors. If I could ask for more it would be 1) a description of each of the categories eg: 62-97 = Poor etc .... 2) a comment about what to do (not to do) at certain levels eg Hazardous - stay indoors/do not exercise outside/wear a P25 mask if outside etc.","4"
"16","AirRater","The information provided is spot on and has assisted with me managing my seasonal allergy identifying additional triggers. Only criticism is I noted animal contact in previous versions, given I have animals, as it wasn’t clear that it only wanted me to report my perceived triggers. Now it shows animal contact as a trigger to my symptoms and I can’t change this.","4"
"17","AirRater","This app was working very well until a few days ago and this is the time it’s essential we have an easy-to-access app monitoring air pollution. Please fix this problem so users have access to the data at all times.  Thanks","4"
"18","AirRater","This app doesn't report PM2.5 data correctly. You cannot rely upon this as a reporting tool for air quality. For instance, it shows in areas within the ACT region as being fine air quality with figures between 8 and 40 counts. However real time reporting by ACT health from its three monitoring stations show figures upward 250 to 400 over the same period. Looking out my window it's smoke city with less than 500 metres visibility. Please fix your data and algorithms.","1"
"19","AirRater","Most accurate and useful - particularly in the bushfire and pollen seasons. With this version it is still hard to work out which pollen type is currently high. I need to access this data easily, daily, to prevent asthma events.","4"
"20","AirRater","The info is good, but every time I try to access the app I am asked to log in or register again. And once I’m logged in I need to reset what I want to see on the map, and my location. Really annoying since I’m checking multiple times a day to see when it’s safe to exercise outside.","3"
"21","AirRater","Good data - easy to read and add location but not time stamped. Infuriatingly I have to log in each time I open the app - it doesn’t remember me even though I’m registered. So type the email, then the password. That got real old, real fast.","4"
"22","AirRater","The app doesn’t say when the reading was last updated. The readings are not consistent with the readings put out by the ACT dept of health website which uses the same air quality stations so I’m not sure which is correct.","4"
"23","AirRater","Mad times we live in to have to download such an app but it’s easy to use and offers much needed data on the air quality in different locations around Australia.","5"
"24","AirRater","Great App could be improved by explaining what the parts per million mean ? What’s good ? I can see 30 is poor but what is good ? Also i am using i phone you can’t make text bigger I have to reach for my glasses to read the figures .","4"

"26","AirRater","I find this a useful real time app that just works. I think it would be helpful if you can use the AQI numbers as well and not just the pm2.5 figures, even though they are the same thing it helps with comparisons across platforms.","4"
"27","AirRater","So pleased to learn this is available. I have set it for 3 most frequent locations I attend, just to be informed in advance. In future, I’d like to see more details of the pollutants (unless I haven’t yet found that on the app!).  Thanks","4"
"28","AirRater","Data updated often; been very helpful especially with the recent bushfires in Tasmania to know where the smoke is. Handy for pollen as well.","5"
"29","AirRater","This app helps me decide whether to exercise outside vs inside during allergy season and reassures me that my respiratory symptoms have external sources and aren’t in my head or exaggerated.","5"
"30","AirRater","Using it all the time to check when it’s safe to go outside 😕 Great if the ‘anonymous’ login would stop forcing me to reset everything every week!","4"

"34","AirRater","As an asthmatic triggered by wood smoke this app is a literal lifesaver, in making me aware of the risks of going outside during winter. And in summer during fire season.","5"
"35","AirRater","It is critical that this is updated more regularly than what it is currently. Windows had to be closed in Deakin last night but the app stated that the air quality was good. This morning is worst with Black Mountain Tower under a blanket of smoke but yet the app states that the air quality is”likely good”. People with respiratory issues need a reliable tool","1"
"36","AirRater","If you want to add a symptom the popup showed up behind the keyboard and you cant ever add one. There is also no quality number index shown. Every other app and website gives you a number.. for eg- today canberra monash is at 236. Just saying poor ir hazardous does not help me at all","2"
"37","AirRater","This is a great app when it’s working, but it’s so often offline that it can be frustrating.  Once this bug is sorted it will be 5 stars for sure.","3"

"59","AirRater","This is a great app.  I have asthma andit helps me keep an eye on conditions.","5"
"60","AirRater","A family member suffers from allergies and knowing the pollen count and particulate amount is helpful. I have just used the app anonymously so far.  I think the interface is a little clunky but adequate. There are a few specific issues I have with the information supplied. Firstly although g/m3 is defined as grains not grams for pollen count in the help area I think it is confusing to label graphs and dials as ug/m3 and then g/m3 for particulates and pollen respectively. Clearly one g is grams and the other g grains. Not being familiar with pollen measurements it took me a while to figure this out. How could there be 70 grams per cubic metre of pollen in the air?  I think there is space on the air quality dials and graphs to write grains instead of just g for pollen count. It makes it clear to the lay person  what the measure is.  Secondly it seems to me that the  pollen count by family graph values do not add up enough to produce some very high values in the total pollen count graph? I would like some  tick marks on the x axis weekly pollen graphs to make clear where days begin and end.  It would also be nice to have more daily measurements to cope with pollen count changes associated with changing air masses. Finally, I found that switching between monthly and weekly pollen data graphs cause the app to fail to update the graphs and it is necessary to close the app and restart to get it working again. I have not used the symptom input side of the app so I cannot comment on that.  Please keep up the good work.","4"
"61","AirRater","An extremely useful guide and warning system","4"

"1","Emergency: Severe Weather App","…But has gotten intrusive and annoying lately. The app now has a gray bar on the locations screen that says:   Critical Alerts Disabled Learn more to never miss an alert  …That leads to unhelpful, irrelevant FAQs if you tap it, even though I have all alerts enabled and push notifications. There is no way to dismiss this gray bar or even understand why it is there.  Furthermore, it made me choose a home location for no discernible reason when I opened the app today, even though I monitor several locations. Creepy and made more suspect when the app asks for camera permissions when you try to attach a screenshot in their feedback form, and fails to attach and disables the attachment button if camera permissions are not granted.  Worst of all, the alert notifications do not display a location, so you have to tap them or open the app to find out where the incident is. A huge, unnecessary pain for people like me that monitor multiple locations, as the app encourages you to do.  If I hear back from the development team I will update this review, but for now, three stars is generous.","3"
"2","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Great app, and I love the fact that I can monitor multiple things in just one app, but it needs some work! I wish the locations and radius were better, like in the Tornado app!! This app includes the entire county for a location, not just specific zip codes which I think is better!! Especially when dealing with tropical systems like hurricanes, as my inland area often has different advisories/watches/warnings than my county’s coastal areas (speaking from nearly 40yrs of living in South FL!)!!! Plus it doesn’t even include smaller towns, and you can’t even edit your radius!!!! I monitor all of my family’s locations (and I have a lot!), and some friends too. Well for instance one family member lives in the Upper FL Keys, and you don’t even have their island when I tried to add it! In the tornado app you do have their island, but this app doesn’t AND includes the Entire FL Keys when adding an Upper Key you do have!🤦🏻‍♀️ Which when dealing with tropical systems like I mentioned earlier is NOT good, especially as The Lower, Middle & Upper Key’s are often spilt into different watches/warnings!! So I would appreciate fixing that please, especially before hurricane season!!! Other than that great job!!!!👍","4"
"3","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I installed this because the far-superior Tornado app is being discontinued. This worthless piece of junk immediately started blowing up my phone every day, sometimes twice a day, with screeching emergency notifications complete with siren because of a “heat event” (temperatures over 99) that is being forecast for more than a week from now.   Noisy, intrusive notifications EVERY DAY, not because of an approaching tornado, not because of an imminent severe thunderstorm, but just because the weather is going to be a little hotter than usual more than a week from now. The app treats every little thing like a screaming emergency — after all this crying wolf, it is useless for a real emergency.  And turning off notifications defeats the entire point of having the app.  Typical that the excellent Tornado app is thrown in the garbage so it can be replaced with a useless showpiece like this one that was put together with absolutely no idea of actual utility or of genuinely making people safer. But hey, someone’s crony got a fat contract out of it and who cares about those rubes in flyover country anyway, right?","1"
"4","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The Red Cross storm app was the best that I found. It allowed me to pick multiple specific locations, establish a radius as a notification zone, then select the type of alerts that would trigger an actual tone notification on my phone. Mainly, it allowed me to EXCLUDE the annoying “Watch” and only alert me when a tornado was not only on the ground, but also within the zones that were preset. I don’t understand why they decided to ditch this app and replace it with something that is too broad with so limited customization. If they wanted me to have full county or city coverage, why not just include that as options? So far today my phone has continuously alerted me that I’m in a tornado watch zone, or that it’s been canceled, or that a new watch zone is now in effect. I know that’s the case, I can look outside and see the weather. So if this is a CYA legal thing, just give me the form where I can waive my ability to sue if the app doesn’t work the way it was intended. I’ll sign it!","1"
"5","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Where I live was hit by a devastating tornado last year and almost nobody in town received any weather alerts or if they did it was to late for them to take cover. There were many homes and lives lost that night. Since then we have all been searching for better apps to gives us alerts. I mean counting this one, I have 11 weather apps on my phone. That’s how traumatizing the events of last year were for myself and so many others. Out of all of my apps this is the ONLY ONE that sends me alerts consistently and early enough to prepare. If I do receive notifications from any of my other apps it is always well after I’ve already heard from this one. I have used our towns Facebook page to recommend this weather app to everyone so we can stay safe! ❤️","5"
"6","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I finally downloaded this app in anticipation of the Earthquake app being sunsetted later this summer. Almost immediately, I began receiving emergency notifications for three out of my seven selected locations, as often as every five minutes. This app seems to cry wolf at an extremely excessive rate, and there seems to be no option to control how many notifications and for what types of emergencies one receives. Unlike an earthquake, excessive heat is a phenomenon one dan usually anticipate in advance, and so does not rise to the same level of emergency status. My friends in my selected locations are far more at risk from a wildfire or earthquake than excessive heat. It’s bad enough I am debating removing the app within 24 hours of downloading it, even though it took five tries to get it to download. Why replace a perfectly fine app with one that still has so many glitches?!","2"
"7","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This is what I consider as the best app for its purpose, out of those that I am aware of. It presents a quality interface and breadth of information, with links to additional useful resources. It is very good at providing timely notifications on any monitored locations, which the user can define, and does so in an effective, concise format.  The primary complaint I have is the collection of personally-identifiable information, which I consider completely unnecessary for the app’s stated purpose. I can understand the developer’s desire, and possible need, to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information, but no more than that.  To the developer: please change your data collection practices, as suggested above.","4"
"8","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Looking for an app that can tell me realtime if anything is happening in the Azores Islands as I have a good deal of family there, as well as my fathers childhood home right on the coast of Sao Lourenço ... my fear has always been with hurricanes & tropical storms, tsunami, & volcanic activity ; & so I was referred to this app. Imagine my confusion, being told there was no results to my search while trying to add Azores Islands as a location to monitor ... they seem to include Madeira on the map, but no Azores... & everytime I tried to add a city in Portugal or Madeira (Lisbon, for example) it would give me Lisbon New York USA & all related search terms IN THE US -- & wouldn't allow me to monitor any part or portion of Portugal!!! What the heck?!! This app is pointless. I know all too much what's happening in the US, it's being shoved in my face from every direction; what I was looking for was information on THE WORLDS HAPPENINGS we don't hear about normally. Plz resolve this silly flaw","1"
"9","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Seriously frustrating to have the constant interruption of this continual notification about the same thing. Even if you go to the App and read the message, it continually interrupts sending one after the next. So annoying. I have already reported this and they responded but it continues. Have to get rid of this app very soon as it’s overwhelming. It continually goes off even if my phone is turned off.   It would be ideal if once the consumer responded, the app would stop sending multiple notifications. If I’m swiping it off of my screen it means I have read the notification why does it keep coming on and on. tonight I actually hit 10 times even though I kept pushing it away and even went to the app to look at it continue to notify me even though I was on the app. Annoying","1"
"10","Emergency: Severe Weather App","When I get a notification of an event it does not tell me the location. When I expand that notification (clicking only once) I still don’t get it. Only when I fully open it up do I get a location. I have 5 locations set and don’t get alerts on all of them. I am very appreciative of being able to check on the fuzzy safety of my family and friends, but with all the bizarre weather we have been having, these alerts are mind blowing torture and time consuming to open. Please add on that these seem to be guesses and more often than not do not happen. My experience is mostly in mid to west Texas (and DFW areas).   If this improves, I will add 2 more stars.","3"
"11","Emergency: Severe Weather App","---Same Day 1.]I wanted Tornado alerts not Hurricane alerts. Please make the notifications setting less clutter looking.  2.]For the badges and all that’s great. But when I want to learn more about it you guys just make me retake the quiz again. I think once we earn it we should be allowed access to the connections we need in case of that emergency, more information on how to deal with it, and the option to retake the quiz (and possibly the correct answers, if we already of the badge).  3.]For people with shaky hands or big fingers, please allow a dropdown or a type in function for the radius adjustment.  4.]If we download another app for emergencies. Because I saw you guys have a separate one of tornadoes but no tornado alert notification in this general app. Could you allow us to share information with it? So we don’t have to re-add everything again. Just an account and a free (no account) import and export option.  5.]Allow a change in measurements (metric & imperial) and temperature (Celsius & Fahrenheit). With the ability to monitor the miles and kilometers too.  I will continue to update this.","3"
"12","Emergency: Severe Weather App","A lot of things you can’t customize like you could in the tornado app. I’m not sure why they would replace it with an app that’s not even close to the Tornado app.  I’m sitting thru a bad storm right now, wondering if this has the tornado warning siren that comes thru my phone like the Tornado app did!  I got a tornado warning thru that app on my phone for my daughters location, I called her because I was worried…she thought I was crazy and 5 mins later her local tornado warning went off. It was amazing….I am sitting here hoping you added that to this app!!!! Plz let me know it will certainly improve my rating!!!","3"
"13","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Update:  have now disabled notifications because they occur in triplicate and at times are every couple of hours for the same alert.  They have become a nusence.  This app was prematurely released and should be pulled back.  Currently this product is inferior to the apps (Earthquake, Hurricane) it’s replacing. With the old apps I could set them up differently. You can’t do that under Emergency. Currently, I have the mile range set at 1 mile (default) for my location but am getting alerts for issues that are more than 25 miles away that have no bearing on my location. You can’t set mile range differently for the different types of alerts (earthquakes, weather). I don’t see alerts for shelter in place for chemical spills or smoke from wildfires. I hope these issues can be addressed.","1"
"14","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I don’t understand why there  is a limit on the number of locations that can be monitored. I use to really like this app for three reasons. One, there was no limit on the locations you could monitor. And for a storm Spotter like myself, that was great. All other apps had limits on locations. Two, the alerts were full text bulletins. Three, the alerts were timely. I’ve removed this app, however, if the app is set back to the way it was, I’ll give it a try. I did like that the locations were in alphabetical order that was great and should be kept but there should be no limits on locations. If you don’t have an app to monitor alerts don’t put restrictions and tie peoples hands. Now please fix it back the way it was this is ridiculous.","1"
"15","Emergency: Severe Weather App","With just a bit more tweaking this app could be perfect. I’d love a loud and continuous siren (maybe mimicking outdoor tornado alarms) to wake me if there is a tornado in the middle of the night. But there is only one notification tone and it is very polite.   Really love being able to filter out nuisance alerts like severe thunderstorms; We see them all the time and they’re not worth me being alerted to them. And settings retain across phone reinstalls which is fantastic.   But hey app developers, if the notification tones for the absolute worst emergencies are not configurable, many alerts will be missed.","4"
"16","Emergency: Severe Weather App","1.) I agree with other reviews on locations.  2.) Also, being in Tornado Alley and being hit this spring, I wish there was a way to add info FOR the Red Cross. ie Electricity required for medical equipment. Incapacitated person in home. Things like that are critical in an emergency.   We had a hard time quickly moving downstairs because the alert went off AFTER the tornado was here. Hail woke us, ran to switch to battery power for equipment and grab baby to run to the basement. Alert went off and sirens started. Hail stopped. Damage was done. There was no warning.","3"
"17","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I hate writing negative reviews without contacting the app developer first, but this one needs posted.  Not to sound dramatic, but my experience with this app has led me to the conclusion that this app could actually cost someone their life. I say this because of the delay from the time the National Weather Service issues something like a Tornado Warning or Severe Thunderstorm Warning, to the time the app alerts you. I have a local news stations weather app, and it alerts me almost immediately when a warning is issued. This app’s alert typically comes in four minutes later. Four minutes doesn’t seem like much, but can be the difference between surviving a tornado and not.   If you have this app, I highly recommend you at least download a second app that is more timely with their alerts. I really hope the developer sees this to look into the root cause of the delay.  One other complaint. I don’t need to be woken up in the middle of the night by the app to inform me that a Thunderstorm Watch has expired.","1"
"18","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Fewer settings unable to connect family and friends More confusing to use I was getting alerts for a high wind storm on the old app. This new app did not alert until after the storm hit. I live in a rural area and 1 mile radius is not enough. I was at the nearest grocery store which is 10 miles away from my house. I do like some of the preparedness but do not need to scroll thru things that do not affect me such as hurricane volcano earthquake. I should be able to rate them or hide the ones that I don’t want to see.","3"
"19","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This is a must have app, it has come in handy numerous times. whether it be here in my own home or other family members throughout the state. when the alert comes in, I know that this app is giving me accurate information, and warnings so I can protect my family and alert others. this app all so provides useful information so you are ready and prepared for the moments when protecting yourself and others is called into action.","5"
"20","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The old “Tornado” app was more effective at providing situational awareness both visually and practically.  1) the main screen allowed you to see what disasters the specific location was being covered for in the app, 2) it allowed for linking critical contacts to the location for easy and efficient welfare checks, 3) site limitations, while recently expanded to 8 is still not enough.  I use this app for personal location.  I’m in the emergency response field and commercial products are available for the work environment.  Do you have any intentions to address the 3 items listed above?","2"
"21","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I like the app, and it provides useful information while I am using it. What I don’t like, however, is receiving 15 notifications a day. Yes, I’m well aware we’re having a heatwave. One alert would have done, not (quite literally) 15. I’ve had to turn notifications off entirely because they became so frequent and intrusive. This makes the app less helpful, because now I won’t be able to receive the rare, useful notification.","3"
"22","Emergency: Severe Weather App","If there is an emergency, this app will let you know (often a few minutes after all the weather apps alert). But then when an emergency is lifted (tornado watch cancelled, for example), it alerts with the same sound and headline, though the details show it's the ending of an emergency.   Especially when people are already nervous, getting an alert about tornado warning, severe thunderstorm, etc. when it's actually the *exact opposite* can be scary. I reached out to the developers about this; it's still not fixed.","2"
"23","Emergency: Severe Weather App","On several occasions I didn’t get ANY alerts from this app during severe thunderstorms, which, to me, was the entire point of the app. Ironically, the Tornado app that I still have that is supposed to be replaced by this app, DID alert me every single time… Another non-related weather app I have also alerted me each time a thunderstorm warning or watch occurred, but not this Emergency app. I’m beginning to have doubts about this app now. If I’m not getting alerts (and I have them turned ON under my Settings and I have locations set within the app) and still not getting alerts, but am from other apps, then something is wrong.","1"
"24","Emergency: Severe Weather App","We were talking on a zoom chat with her last weekend but we had no plans on that and we had no choice and I didn’t think it could have done it so I’m sorry but she is a good person I think we can talk to you about that if she can do anything to make us better. We have been trying so many things that are going wrong in the last year. I’m just not being honest.","4"
"25","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Love this app! It gives me iPhone home screen banner alerts whenever any of my family members’ or friends’ areas are under weather threats. I love that! But the banners do not include the name of the monitored location. You have to click on the banner and launch the app just to find out which of your monitored locations the flood/storm/etc banner alert pertains to - a curious oversight. Nevertheless, i highly recommend this app.","5"
"26","Emergency: Severe Weather App","A year ago there was a tornado within 50 miles of us, and we live in the middle of pine forests where there have been wildfires, so we wanted a way to be notified. This seemed to fit the bill. But I find myself thinking about deleting it because I can’t tell you how many times it has blared a warning at 3:30 or 4:00 in the morning to tell me about a status change to take place 6 to 8 hours later. Scares the heck out of me when there is no need.","3"
"27","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app will monitor your moving location for emergencies that you have set up. You can also monitor the location of your family and friends or just select general locations. This app provides alerts for everything from tornado to air quality.  Red Cross has also added a robust emergency training and quizzes to this app. Stay safe in grey skies and increase your preparedness in blue skies.","5"
"28","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The is a good app and I appreciate the timely warnings about severe weather and tornado watches and warnings. However, the inability to pinpoint the center of your warning area is frustrating. For example, I am about 30 miles from the center of the closest metro area. Now I get warnings from 60 miles away on the other side of town if I make my notification ring 30 miles wide. Hopefully they can fix that soon.","3"
"29","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The updated app no longer shows maps of my chosen locations. The maps displayed the radius I chose to monitor, and the alert area, when I clicked on an alert, or selected a chosen location. Now it shows only a map of my location no matter what location or alert I select. Plus useless scenic photos. To me this is a poorly thought out update. I think it shows a lack of common sense.   Please go back to displaying location maps showing radius monitored and alert area for each location I entered into the app.  The only good thing I’ve seen is the option to monitor my location outside the locations I entered into the app. Please keep this option, but return to displaying maps for the locations I choose to monitor. Show the monitored radius, as well as the alert boundaries for the locations I inputted to the app.  I can no longer recommend this app in it’s present version.","1"
"30","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The app changed from English to Spanish and there is no setting option to change it back and the link for App Support goes to a website that does nothing but list their other apps!  If there is an emergency I don’t want to try and read the alert in a language I have a very small vocabulary in.  Guess I should be glad they didn’t change it to one of the other predominant second languages in my state such as Russian, Chinese, or Vietnamese!  I will be letting Apple know that the required App Support link is worthless as the developer is not providing any avenue to support.","1"
"31","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn’t they’re going to storm and 10 miles of my house let’s find a tornado and I do not get any notification. Half the time I’m not getting notifications the other half of time I’m getting notifications well after the storm has passed. On a rare occasion it works properly. The original tornado app worked perfectly and could be trailered to my specific location. I don’t want warnings for my entire county. I’m in the SE corner of my county and only need warning of a 15 mike radius of both counties.","1"
"32","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Yes, I realize it doesn’t rain very often in Southern California. It’s been raining. Why so many alerts? Every time the national weather service changes a few words on the area weather reports, I get an alert. The last straw was last night at 2:30 AM, when I was sound asleep, and when I have do not disturb for most of my apps. This thing made a loud noise that woke us both up. Just because they might’ve changed a word on the weather report. You need to tweak your app.","2"
"33","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Okay, it’s a good weather app or whatever, it warns me of stuff I guess.  The notifications, oh my god, I literally just deleted the app because it threw like a dozen notifications at me in seconds causing my phone to almost buzz its way off the stand. I’m sick of it, please for the love of god why? I don’t understand it’s just so many notifications with the exact same message, idk if I did something wrong but I don’t even care anymore, I’m only making this one star so maybe someone can see it and be warned, but I’m just done!!!! It’s just so many notifications and it’s been happening so much good golly ;w;","1"
"34","Emergency: Severe Weather App","They closed the Hurricane, Tornado, and Earthquake apps, but this Emergency app does absolutely nothing well, so we are basically stranded unless we have access to good weather apps, the NOAA apps, and local government apps. In the Red Cross Emergency app, the Alerts include Expired alerts that are counted as Active.  This is seriously misleading when there are no Active alerts. The maps views open to include a shelter in Texas - but my only followed Location is in Florida.  The map should open to my Home location in Florida. Red Cross gets a Red Zero for this Texas centered app.  What about the rest of us?","1"
"35","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I just read in the latest update notes that you no longer will send push notifications when NOAA cancels an alert. This was actually a feature that set this app apart from many others I used in the past.  This feature is useful for many reasons when it is impractical to check the app (driving, working, sheltering-in-place, conserving phone battery during an emergency, etc.).   Please bring this feature back!","2"
"36","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The previous app was ten times better. This one you can only track six of your friends. Haven't found oit how to delete a location so you can enter a different location. Moral of this app you can't have more than six friends. Whe you have a senetr storm alert at 2:30 pm and a tornado watch at 6:00 pm they both stay as alerts even though the other alert is over/cancelled does not remove it from your app. Trying to make this app better by combine it with yhe hurricane red cross was a mistake. It did not make it better but made it worse.","1"
"37","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I recently moved to the South Eastern coast and decided to try out several weather apps in preparation for hurricane season. Well - here I am in August with a category 3 storm coming my way, 6 or more apps installed and Red Cross is the only one that will not give me any storm updates. I've gotten surge warnings, storm warnings, and flood watches from all the other apps. But Red Cross consistently says I have no alerts for my area. I've made sure the location is set and settings are enabled and still nothing. This is honestly a completely useless app for real time safety.","1"
"38","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Too much information on screen that is NOT relevant to the User. I don’t need to know about events on the other side of the country unless I opt-in for it. Tracking every event everywhere might be useful too some but not on mobile devices. Not enough control of what to watch and what I can ignore. Not every calamity hits everywhere at the same time. The original Hurricane Tracker was MUCH better. Due to the multiple untimely alerts I have had to shut the app down. Kind of takes away from the purpose of the app.","1"
"39","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I received a Tsunami warning for my area over 3 hours ago. Looking on various websites (NOAA, etc.) it checks out. My app alerted me though that it was retiring this summer and that I should download the Emergency app, which I did. Hours later & fiddling with the notification options and it’s still saying that there are ‘No Alerts for your area’. Meanwhile, we are still have a Tsunami Warning in my area. An emergency app that fails to accurately give alerts is dangerous, because you are relying it to do something it does not reliably do. I am deleting this app.","1"
"40","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app used to be great. Now, I’ve lost all my monitoring locations. No matter how many times I reenter them, they’re gone. Somehow, I am getting alerts, but I’m getting too many. I monitor a 5 mile radius and get 6-8 alerts for every event. So annoying. I will click on an alert to see it’s a warning area out of my monitored location. I back out of it to try and see which alert applies to me and they’re all gone. The app has become completely unreliable. If they won’t find updating it, it shouldn’t be on the app store so people can use reliable emergency management methods.","1"
"41","Emergency: Severe Weather App","If this Emergency Alert app is supposed to be all-purpose, the Wildfire functionality needs to be beefed up.  Unfortunately the Red Cross “Wildfire” app no longer works under the new IOS, and, this all-purpose Emergency app doesn’t handle fires adequately.     Think about the Napa area fires this last October-what the functionality the app could have had that would have made things better for people who, it turned out, had little or no warning to evacuate from the fast-moving fires.","3"
"42","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Good for various alerts like fires, snow, rain, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc., but needs work. It prompts you for people you care about in a particular town that you specify. But if you exit the app then those contacts are lost. Same with the “I’m safe” feature - great idea but in an emergency I want the contacts loaded and ready so I can just send loved ones the message that I’m alright. Those contacts aren’t saved either. Otherwise good app.","3"
"43","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I’ve had this app on my phone long time and it works fine on phone but I don’t get any of the weather alert on my apple watch. I’m Deaf and rely on the watch to alert me by vibrating to let me know things while I’m sleeping. When emergency sends a tornado warning to my phone I get nothing on my watch. If one happened here while I was asleep id be dead because no watch vibrating alert to wake me.","3"
"44","Emergency: Severe Weather App","During periods of inclement weather I receive too many redundant alerts, one right after another. Made more annoying by the fact that I can’t mute the alerts in the app settings (the only way to mute the alerts is to put your phone on Silent). After the first 2 or 3 alerts I end up deleting the location just to avoid noisy notifications.","3"
"45","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Will increase score when it allows monitoring an area smaller than 1-2 entire counties! My son’s city is near another county so now it requires that I receive alerts for TWO entire counties, which include areas that are over 100 miles from where he lives! PLEASE change this!   Also, the keyboard constantly disappears while trying to type a review.","3"
"46","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Tornado app was much better, we have livestock in 3 counties & I was used to monitoring all those counties, plus in the county I live in, plus the county I work in. Seems like this new app will only allow you to monitor where you have set your home location, plus wherever you might physically be without having to change locations on the fly- which is hard to do when you are commuting in a storm. Very disappointed.","2"
"47","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This application is a simple yet effective way to stay on top of potential hazardous situations that may affect you or your loved ones. The app makes it easy to set locations and the radius in which you would like to monitor around these set pinpoints. The app also provides useful information regarding emergencies in how to handle them including finding shelters and making an emergency family plan.","3"
"48","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I understand that it was supposed to send you alerts but it was 3 in the morning when they sent a red flag warning in my area 💀✋ Like, okay but its 3 in morning and gave me a heart attack for a second. Overall, its not completely accurate but its good- it shows that it works and attempts to keep you alerted, it definitely did get me alerted! Would recommend","4"
"49","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Having used the Red Cross apps for years I’m having to retain all the old ones, read that it’s retired and click to go to the new app. Where is the “download” cloud hiding? Apparently the new app is still a secret, for months I’ve been unable to find it because it doesn’t actually show up as “Emergency” or “Red Cross Emergency” via Apple apps.","4"
"50","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Like others, I was forced to this app because the Tornado app was end of life. This app is not a good replacement.   Firstly, having notifications by county is silly. We live right on the border of a county so do not expect alerts from 100s of miles north. It should be set from a radius of your home location.   Secondly, and this is probably the most disappointing, the app is reporting “no alerts found” even though at this very moment we are in the middle of a *huge* thunderstorm.","2"
"51","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Nice to have  notification but annoying when it keeps going off . Needs to have  notifications that just come up on the screen or a button to silence  but still get notifications","5"
"52","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app has a ton of potential. However it is not as good as the tornado app where I can just sent a circle around my area to watch. This is broken up by weird blocks of space.   It tools some figuring out but you have to manually configure some of the features that were standard in tornado.","4"
"53","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app used to be awesome. There wasn’t a limit on how many areas I could monitor. I used to be able to monitor very specific areas and attach contact info of the people I knew who lived in these areas. NOW, I can only monitor 5 general areas, no contacts, the alerts don’t work. It’s like what’s the point? Why is this app even taking up real estate on my devices? Please roll back two or three years to what this app used to be. I get better info from the standard weather app at this point.","1"
"54","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Before the severe thunderstorm hit, the app went off. Soon after it passed, it notified us that the alert was over. Sure works for me. Btw, I’ve had the app for a while and this was the first time it’s gone off. It warns of ‘Severe’ weather. Not every every bit of rain and rumble of thunder.😉”…and that’s a good👍🏼thing.”🙂—Martha S","4"
"55","Emergency: Severe Weather App","We had a 4.7 Earthquake wake us up at 2:51 am in WA this morning. It was strong enough to wake to shake the house big time. With a strong aftershock. About 10 minutes later we got the Alert from this app. The primary use case of this app is to warn of an emergency so we can take action before it hits us and it failed. I realize it probably didn’t receive its data in time due to other 3 rd party systems. But the bottlenecks need to be identified and fixed. That’s what the apps main value is and is advertised as.","1"
"56","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The old tornado app from these guys was forcibly retired.  That app had annoying constant alerts with no way to acknowledge and mute repeated alerts.  For a while i had both apps.  This app never sends any alerts i can open it and see them but the whole point is to help you prepare.  So this is useless.  Iphone 13 max plus & ios 16.6 so the issues are in the app itself.  Shame the old app at least had purpose.","2"
"57","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I Love This App For Monitoring Weather Alerts And Feeling Safe Knowing As Soon As One Is Issued I’m Alerted About It!

"58","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This most recent update (3.11.0) wiped out all of my settings. I’m monitoring seven locations, all with different regional concerns and radii. Setting up these locations was already unnecessarily tedious and time-consuming, especially as they need to be carefully refined over time to minimize the many irrelevant alerts. And now they’re all gone. Poof. Same thing with the other two Red Cross apps I use. All personal monitoring settings completely wiped out. I am beyond dissatisfied. Useless.","2"
"59","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The app really wants you to enable Critical Alerts, and will constantly remind you they are off. I am confident I do not want Critical Alerts on. My phone blaring at 3am because a hurricane was detected hundreds of miles away is going to make me less able to respond to that threat, not better prepared for it. I wish the app would respect my choice. Forcing useless Critical Alerts on people waters down the utility of the entire feature.","2"
"60","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I strongly recommend using this app. We get alerts for all kinds of hazardous conditions, like wildfire or ice storms that allow us to prepare and evacuate if needed. When traveling, the app has alerted us to tornadoes and hailstorms so we could find shelter rather than drive into danger.","5"
"61","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The entire west coast is rated as having “fire weather” which means the app goes off repeatedly all day and all night. There isn’t an actual fire however just the potential. You can’t shut it off and I’m at the point of deleting the app because I don’t need to be woken up four to five times a night by and app telling me it’s hot out.","3"
"62","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Used the previous “Tornado” app with good success. Now I’ve received a message that it is being replaced by this app. What a pain! Much more cumbersome to use. Way too much information I don’t need. Can’t see a list of my monitored locations in one place.  I could go on and on. Bring back the simplicity of “Tornado” or I will likely dump this app and just use a local TV station’s weather app. Very disappointed!","2"
"63","Emergency: Severe Weather App","If this app is replacing the Tornado app, I am seriously disappointed. There is no place for an emergency flashlight, or the strobe light that was on it and you there’s no way to make sure that the tornado siren will go off. I am completely disappointed with this app and praying that you will not get rid of the red Cross tornado app. At least it’s functioning and it works. It has saved my life six times. I will be deleting this app. Thank you.","2"
"64","Emergency: Severe Weather App","They need to do something about this. Every notification is not endlessly critical and should not been over and over again even after you dismiss it.  The rest seems to be fine. Wish it was a global Emergency App. Would help when traveling","3"
"65","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app makes us feel safe and has quizzes to train your brain    and prepare you the event of an EMERGENCY. This app also guides you to learning first aide. This app has a siren to warn your family of severe weather. After a severe storm there is an “I’m Safe” signal that your location is clear of storms. Congrats on a great app .","5"
"66","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Over all this works fine but I don’t need a alert to tell me the alert as expired or a alert that tells me the storm that caused the alert has moved on or a alert that tell me a severe rain storm is going to cause flash flood. Within 30 min I received 7 alerts about the status of the same storm cell. So frequent I disabled the alerts ....... so a program to alert that the alerts are disabled ...... see the problem?","2"
"67","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The only issue I have with this app so far is there is no way to share an alert with someone that it may be eminent to.  The Tornado and Hurricane apps that this one is replacing allowed me to do that.  We need to be able to share the threats with those loved ones who may not be aware and simply do not have the capability to have this app.","3"
"68","Emergency: Severe Weather App","... until this latest update. The programmers clearly took over with no forethought or oversight as to what is actually needed in an emergency. First and foremost: SIMPLICITY. Fewer taps is better. Less BUSY is better. Less clutter is better- if I have this app, I already know how to prepare! Get rid of that crap, or AT THE VERY LEAST, let me! Also, how do I delete alerts I've already read??? I shouldn't have ask. I will be moving on unless these issues are addressed in short order...","1"

"70","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Since downloading this I am getting alerts for things that are not even occurring.  For example, there is a NWS bulletin that there is a winter storm warning for my home, then I get a message that says snowfall has stopped.  My home is not even in any area of snow fall and is bone dry at home. Can't rely on something that is not providing correct information.","3"
"71","Emergency: Severe Weather App","There are too many screens and too many options. I wanted something simple that would alert me to severe weather in my area. It took me several minutes just to find the screen where I could select the alerts I’m interested in. I still haven’t found the “overlays” mentioned in the description. Too comprehensive equals not useful.","2"
"72","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app has notified me of weather changes 6-10 hours before local news.  Living in an area where hail, windstorms and flooding occur, this is incredibly helpful.  It gives you an opportunity to do things ahead of time.","5"
"73","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I think this will become a well used app but really wish the focus on opening would be to my main surrounding location instead of the huge expanded view of US and oceans making me have to zoom in.","4"
"74","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app doesn’t work half the time. It shows live alerts when I’m sitting at home based on my location, but no alert for my home area that it asked me to set based on address, despite the fact that they’re the same area. This app is supposed to provide some of the most important time-sensitive information I could possibly need, and it works less often than games I play. Do better.","1"
"75","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Just alerted me to an incoming tornado 10 seconds before the sirens went off, and well before any of my other apps caught up to the unexpected touchdown! The tornado shifted its path and we were okay. Super thankful for this app! Worked outstandingly!","5"
"76","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app used to have the ability to set locations with certain people to notify or check in on them in case of harsh weather.

Disaster areas should be top priority for alerting people with safety procautions. I’m never disappointed and a concerned citizen living in these areas.","1"
"78","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This is the second company that has released an update that ruined an app. Kroger ruined the Harris Teeter app and now the Red Cross is replacing the great Tornado app with this. An excellent way to get lots of people to delete an app from their devices. I stopped shopping at Harris Teeter but the Red Cross is a national institution and should be rethinking how it has handled this merging of all its apps. I will stick with the Tornado app until it finally stops working then I’ll invest in a NOAA radio.","1"

Based on your poor reviews, you need to focus on improving the app, NOT YOUR POLITICAL AGENDA!!","1"
"81","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The app finally updated after over a year. When I tried to add a city I wanted to monitor it kept taking me away from the specific area I was interested in. The direction moved more to the east, away from the area, rather than moving in a westerly direction. I expanded the radius to 75 miles and it didn’t work.","3"
"82","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app is supposed to be for emergency warnings but it is not intuitive and has multiple layers that take too much time to setup if you can even find the levels required to get anything done. Hope it works when it should although I doubt it.  It’s a hopeless mess. This is what happens when the only ones involved with the interface are techies.","1"
"83","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Let’s just start with the Map.  It is useless. Mostly it shows locations of shelters.  According to this app:  1. The Red Cross only has 20 shelters in the entire US.  2. There are ZERO shelters west of Arkansas until you get to California.  So as far as the Red Cross app is concerned, the middle of the US - where we have most of the dangerous weather - is on their own.  “Provide your own shelter, folks.”  At a minimum: we should be able to turn off the shelters shown (they clutter the map).  But of course, we can’t.  Anything that is this poorly done makes me question trusting it in an emergency.    Who ran this app project?   Did anyone test it?  Ask anyone outside the project team for input ?It’s awful.","1"
"84","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I loved the individual catastrophe apps.  Thought this one would be just as helpful. WRONG- it continually screams alerts even after you shut them down.  When I went back to see why I was still getting alerts,  all of the toggles were set back to “on”.  I deleted the app and STILL get alerts.  It has wormed its way into my phone.  I will alert Apple of a possible intrusion.","1"

"86","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Like several other’s reviews, I’m not getting alerts. I’m in the tech industry and definitely understand how to ensure notifications are on and the various alert settings. The developers fir this app have a significant bug.

"87","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I miss the tornado app, it at least told me even there was a thunderstorm warning and or watch, and tornado watches, this one hasn’t given me a single notification of anything, been having severe thunderstorm warnings and heat advisory’s/ warnings, and not a single notification, even have everything turned on, than gifs AccuWeather works.","2"
"88","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I’m not sure why Red Cross did away with the previous UI. This version isn’t as user controllable as it used to be. If you looking for a great app for tornado and thunderstorm watches/warnings, Red Cross has another “Tornado” app strictly for those two occurrences… it’s exactly like this app used to be but condensed down to tornado and thunderstorms only which works well for me out here on the yellow brick road🌪🏡👠🧹","2"
"89","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This is a great app. It keeps me informed abt oncoming and current severe weather situations, and allows me to keep in touch with my family and friends. I love that it shows a weather radar and also if needed lists shelters I can go to in an emergency.","5"

"92","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Not nearly as good as Tornado was. My phone is blowing up with heat warnings which I can’t seem to turn off. I already know it’s hot and to hydrate 🙄. All I really want is tornado warnings but it gives them for the whole county instead of being able to narrow it down to say a ten mile radius. And there are warnings for lots of things I’m not worried about.","2"
"93","Emergency: Severe Weather App","App is ok but the alert area is the entire county. I live in a huge county and don’t want alerts in the middle of the night for a threat that is miles away and in no way affects me.

"95","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The app notified me of a tornado warning 10 minutes after the actual warning had expired. Thankfully, I was already in my safe spot thanks to my local news.

If you made this app accessible so that those who use the built-in screen-reader for Apple devices that would be even better.","1"
"100","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The changes that have been made are truthfully a downgrade, when you can no longer use the app to actually track a storm in its proximity to your actual location, but rather the app itself seems to only be used as a tracking tool to monitor its users.

"113","Emergency: Severe Weather App","To get the exact same alert multiple times in a given 24 hour period including 2:47 am push outs is ridiculous.  I've already written to the developer asking fort change when user reads the alert the first time, no more alerts should go out UNLESS there is new information.","1"
"114","Emergency: Severe Weather App","We live in a very rural area and this app work well for what we needed.. keeps up to date on weather changes and our family locations and more .. good app .. easy on the battery too..","4"
"115","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Will not allow me to add a home location or turn on live monitoring, rendering the entire app useless. My location permissions are set to always and the app can sense my location via GPS, but saving never works and instead always produces an error message. I miss the Tornado app that did not give me any problems!!","1"
"116","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The newest version removed the Apple Watch app and complications. This makes the app much less useful and lowers it’s rating from a four star experience to a three star experience.","3"
"117","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The map is constantly zooming in on a shelter in either California or Hawaii and there’s no way to remove it. They’re also pushing a climate change agenda which has nothing to do with setting up a tornado warning alert. Stop trying to push your agenda where it isn’t necessary. Do better.","1"
"118","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Thank you for creating an app that gives tips on how to prepare for disasters, how to respond during disasters, and how to keep up to date if loved ones are safe.","5"
"119","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Far too many alerts one right after the other.  Especially when an alert is going to be cancelled.  Just got the same alert cancellation 3-4 times in the last hour.  Enough, already!","3"
"120","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I changed the settings to deactivate notifications for high wind alerts, but I keep getting them. Just now, I got an alert to alert me that there was no longer an alert for something I didn’t want any alerts for.","2"
"121","Emergency: Severe Weather App","It very useful for knowing when storms will hit in the Colorado area (so, directionally, yo know what days you have risk); however, I experienced the same thing as others for the tornado warning. I received the warning after the tornado hit my (monitored) home!","3"
"122","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app lets me keep up with my family all over. It gives me a peace of mind knowing that we can stay connected in bad weather!","5"
"123","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I’ve gotten phone calls at 2am warning of excessive heat index for next day. Not something I feel I should be awakened for in the middle of the night","4"
"124","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I use the app and it’s pretty good for alerts. But the app does not notify when in Do Not Disturb, which is a problem when a tornado or other weather event occurs. Apple has a way developers to go around this by implementing Critical Alerts that bypass Do Not Disturb with the users consent. This app NEEDS this so that people can be alerted at night!","1"
"125","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The app doesn’t follow the user settings. It’s giving me information about a tornado alert more than 50 miles away that doesn’t even impact my direct area in anyway shape or form. Being in the fire service I rely on quality data to be able to make decisions in this app is definitely not up to par I would not recommend it","1"
"126","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I don’t often write reviews, but last night during a tornado outbreak the alert from this app arrived 2 to 3 minutes after my other regular weather apps.  That time can make a difference in an emergency.  I had already woken up, put on shoes and taken shelter by the time I got the alert from this app. I won’t be relying on this app for severe storms.","1"
"127","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I live in tornado country and turned off critical alerts as the scare the daylights out of me. They are too loud and no way to change the sound or volume. Especially at night I swear my neighbor can hear it 🥺","3"
"128","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The old tornado and hurricane apps allow me to add a name to my locations as I keep my eye out for family and friends. I hope the developers let us personalize this app. Useful when my husband looks at my app.","3"

"130","Emergency: Severe Weather App","It would be nice to add locations out of the United States since I have relatives there. The old old Hurricane app used to allow this. It lost it in a later update and I can’t see how to do it in Energency.","3"

"132","Emergency: Severe Weather App","There’s nothing like being woken up in the middle of the night with a tornado warning siren from this app when the tornado warning has absolutely nothing to do with our location in anyway shape or form.

"133","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I now ignore. alerts. because so many  are sent out. STOP IT.

I am deleting the app. nonsense.","1"

"135","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I get an alert that there is a tornado warning in effect but when I hope the app itself, it says no alerts!  Too hard to find information. The old app was much better.","2"
"136","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app definitely lets you know what’s going on. But it is SO unnecessary to send 15 (literally) of the exact same notifications . There was a winter storm coming, and for a full three days before the storm actually hit, I got 15 notifications about it Every. Single. Day. Will be deleting this app out of annoyance.","1"
"137","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I live in a tornado prone area and I get alerted about tornado warnings from this app before anywhere else. Haven’t had any problems whatsoever. Happy to have the app 💯","5"
"138","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I have set the radius miles, but i get warnings for 100 miles away and it repeats over and over and over!

"140","Emergency: Severe Weather App","There’s currently a wind advisory at my location.  I discovered this scrolling through my twitter feed....not because I was alerted by this app.  If you open the app, sure enough it shows that there is a wind advisory.  But it failed to send me a notification about it.  That’s the only reason I downloaded the app and it failed.  One star.","1"
"141","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I would say this is a good app to have for different weather alerts etc! BUT.. they need to add like ACTIVE RADAR etc to this that would really help! We had a tornado warning yesterday and the app came in handy","3"
"142","Emergency: Severe Weather App","What a downgrade. Can’t even set my location because it’s telling me my phone isn’t connected, well I assure you it is. Why discontinue something that worked and replace it with something that doesn’t function at all? Be for real, Red Cross, this app is harming your reputation.","1"
"143","Emergency: Severe Weather App","It used to be a great app. I am just mad that they removed the quiz feature. Also now you can’t add more locations than you used to.","3"

"145","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I went through the setup and then it just goes to a blank white screen with no buttons or options or any controls, and just sits there. It’s completely useless.

"147","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I can find no way to change/add/delete alerts. What, do you set them snd I accept like you’re my mother?? I appreciate that you’re trying to teach preparedness, but people’s lives change and so do our needs in the app. I would give zero stars if I could for user-unfriendliness.","1"

"161","Emergency: Severe Weather App","We had a Flash Flood Watch and a Tornado Watch at the same time.   Only the Flash Flood Watch showed on the Apple Watch. The Tornado watch did not alert on the watch. I would rather know about tornado watches than flash flood watches.","3"

"164","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Download this app for obvious reasons. Constantly get warnings and notifications from areas that are nowhere near me or my current location. I get notifications from places that are over 100 miles away! Don’t waste your time on this one.","1"
"165","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I’m only on day one and I’m disappointed. The radius for my alert is a lot bigger (ie. less accurate) than the tornado app. And I just got a tsunami warning, which is impossible. Very disappointed.","2"
"166","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The app tells me there are no active alerts for the hazards I selected. It never gave me the option to select hazards, and I don’t know which hazards it is monitoring. Except for hurricanes. It says it’s monitoring for hurricanes. I live in Indiana, so I don’t think hurricanes are that relevant to me.","1"
"167","Emergency: Severe Weather App","My husband and I both downloaded this app and almost immediately our inboxes have become filled with junk mail daily. It is not worth it to download and I wouldn’t do it unless you enjoy being bombarded with junk mail. So annoying!","1"
"168","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I am not happy about being forced to move to this app when I tried it before and it really sucked. I have used the tornado app for years and im very disappointed that it’s going away. It’s been very useful and easy to use.","1"

"171","Emergency: Severe Weather App","My tornado app said it will be discontinued and to upgrade to this.  This has all sorts of alerts that are not applicable to my area.

"281","Emergency: Severe Weather App","A great App, which works well on the iPhone, but seems to have some trouble on The Watch. Since it was featured in the Apple Watch App, this was a little surprising.   On the Watch, the first time I used the Family Safe button to test it out, I got a list of people to check on and it worked perfectly. But after that, I could not check on anyone else, because each time I hit the Family Safe button, it went straight to the response from that first person and I could not check on anyone else.   Not sure if this is a bug or if it's really supposed to work only from the phone.","3"

"285","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I live in Southern California and with the potential for earthquakes, wildfires, and strong winds, I downloaded this app immediately after finding out about it in late November 2017. In the two months I’ve used it, I’ve found it is not reliable and not consistent, with some alerts being false information altogether.   Specifically, during the first three weeks of December 2017, wildfires due to heavy winds were popping up every day all over SoCal. I had settings to alert me of all fire activity within 50 miles of my location. Frustratingly, I never received alerts for the wildfires that were within 50 miles of my home. Instead, I was receiving alerts for wildfires in Central and Northern California. Of course, I was attentive to local and regional news to be aware of any sudden evacuation orders. Still, it is a scary thought to think that this app is not providing the life saving alerts that it claims to do.  In addition to the wildfires and others, I also set an alert for earthquakes with a 3.0 magnitude or higher. There was an earthquake in my region after Christmas that registered as a 3.5 and nope, no alert received. Not even a delayed alert.  The only alerts that seem to be reliable and are correct are those for strong winds, winter windchill, and tsunami warning.   I’ll keep the app because it is better than nothing but I do really hope that it is fine tuned to provide correct and reliable data consistently. It could save lives.","2"
"286","Emergency: Severe Weather App","God bless Our American Red Cross!  It's nothing short of a miracle organization with absolutely incredible volunteers!  For them to create an app such as this is simply going above and beyond but of course they do this every single day.  I live very near. The Gulf Coast so I am truly grateful! Thank you SO MUCH to the team that developed this app!!!  If people are having a little trouble with the app be patient...please.  They provide so much on a moment's notice for so many people.  There are more than a bunch of apps out there that when brand new have some glitches.  Personally, I'm certain they'll fix whatever needs fixing!  Give 'Em a break, eh?  I know my iPad gets VERY glitchy if the memory gets low like under 1.5 GB.  And perhaps for the moment the issue with phone number can be handled by changing the phone number type temporarily (home, office, etc.).  You don't have to delete and re type the numbers.","5"
"287","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I was woken up in Sarasota Florida to a loud siren on my phone with a warning about an approaching Tornado. Approximately 15 minutes later a tornado passed within a few miles of us. Shortly thereafter another alert sounded, and a second tornado passed through. Both tornados occurred between 3 & 4 a.m. Without this app we would have  likely slept through it, but we would have been fine. Unfortunately two people were killed just a few miles away and I can't help thinking that had they had a warning system like this they might have survived.","5"
"288","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I love this app, and it's always been very functional! This a must-have and highly needed warning tool (tornadoes are all too common around my area). I definitely recommend this app!   Plus, it alerts me when there are serious weather issues in the various places that my family and friends live.   While I cannot speak for the others having issues with this app, I definitely sympathize with each of them! Living in a rural area, known for tornadic activity, I completely understand the importance of needing to know have accurate, timely reports regarding 'your weather activity' or that of your family or friends...ASAP!   However, I haven't had any problems, and this app works perfectly for me! I have alerts set up to cover several locations, other than my own, with some that are 12-14 hours away, and so far, I've never had a single issue. I'm praying it stays this way too 🙏🏻!","5"
"289","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Downloaded app because I moved to a new area of the country and there are tornado warnings and watches in effect. The app does issue alerts to my iPhone, but I have found three points of frustration: (1) the app automatically uses my current location. I set up my city as a location for when I travel away from my family but I receive double alerts for my city even after turning off and deleting the current location from my alerts. (2) When trying to view alerts, they do often do not load and I receive an error message. (3) I live in a city with Burroughs. When I expand the radius to cover the whole city, I receive multiple alerts for the same overlapping area.","2"
"290","Emergency: Severe Weather App","If there were more features I probably would have given this a higher Rating. One such feature would probably be the radar/map for weather. seeing what kind of weather we might get can be helpful. Also when I first got it I was looking for something specifically, if a nuke was launched, would it let me know? I don't think so. due to the progress of NK missile testing g I feel as if that's one thing I should be prepared for, and I also think that is something they should add.I do like how they can add other people  and the weather alerts, although I have not gotten one, because I literally just got it.","3"
"291","Emergency: Severe Weather App","In the older RC emergency apps (hurricane, flood, wildfire, etc.), there were options to use several different modes of communication (Twitter, SMS, Email), and these seemed to have changed in this app (or it is not obvious). Also, if the user wants to MANUALLY enter their family lists, they are unable to. When the app first opens, if the user chooses not to allow access to contacts (like many of us would prefer not to), the add recipient button no longer works. So, you are stuck.  Overall, I prefer this all-in-one app, but want the I'm safe functionality of the first waves of RC apps.","3"
"292","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I have this 1 star so I could leave a review. I'm an American Red Cross Volunteer and I will NOT recommend this app to anyone until it is reliable! I am going to contact our IT department Monday and see where this leads. I have to see this through because people depend upon the Red Cross, I feel awful that you have confided in us and we have let you all down.  I see all it has the ability to do, all that is great! I like the ability to set boundaries, notify family, alert you about your home address or your current location. When it's fixed I will try again. Please accept MY apology as a Red Cross Volunteer, I am sorry for everyone's trouble. Keep watch and give us another try when it's fixed!","1"
"293","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This is an extremely valuable app.  I just have two suggestions...  1) For checking on family, you need more than just a phone #. It should notify any device attached to the family members (i.e., iPad, computer, etc) even if that device has no phone #. So if someone's phone is lost or damaged in an emergency, they could still respond that they are safe via their iPad, etc.   This could be accomplished by linking devices through not just phone #s, but also via email addresses, iCloud, FaceTime, or even partnering with 3rd party apps like Skype, Facebook Messenger, or Twitter.   2) The alerts should have the ability to set a different radius for each type of alert, rather than all alerts for a location having the same radius.   Other than that, it's very good.","4"
"294","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Great idea, but not ready yet. When you select a location to monitor, it lets you identify people who live there that you would like to notify in an emergency. Unfortunately, it automatically selects their work phone number and won't let you choose a different one. Also, no way to remove a person from a location--must delete the location and start over. This seems more like a beta version than one that is ready to distribute. When you are using an app to warn of danger, you need to know it is solid and ready to respond as needed. This one isn't ready.","2"
"295","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This is no better than the previous tornado app by the Red Cross. They just don't seem to be able to get it right. I don't need warnings for storms many miles away and moving in the opposite direction. I thought it might be the fault of the National Weather Service. Not! The posted NWS warning posted by the app doesn't apply to my city.  A simple but accurate app would be much safer. People would likely pay attention and heed the warnings. My local TV station offers a free weather app that is accurate and reliable. I've also found some other great weather apps in the App Store. I knew this app was mistaken when not even one of the other apps sounded a warning.","1"
"296","Emergency: Severe Weather App","More and More people don't watch regular TV to get Severe Weather Bulletins on Weather Stations, and more off tin than not you are away from a TV anyway for them to reach many folks in time.

It has a few bugs in this version but the notifications one of the most important and best uses of notifications yet! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!","4"
"297","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I like the idea of this app, but need improvement for the execution of it. For e.g., when using family safe, it just texts your family to see if they are safe or not; Doesn't provide the info on why I'm asking if they are safe or not (i.e. share details of emergency alert.) It's a problem because even if they are safe at the time, they could become in danger later if they aren't aware of what danger that might hit them. I would love to add extra info on why I'm using family safe to my family and inform them of the possible danger they might face.","2"

Not user friendly.","2"
"301","Emergency: Severe Weather App","The Notification system is awful. I end up getting the exact same notification every 10-15 minutes about the same warning. It gets pretty annoying.

"320","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I was really excited to use this app, but like others, my tracked locations have been lost twice since setting the app up originally about a month ago.

"456","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Excelente, instructiva y muy necesaria.","5"
"457","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Update: This update does nothing to address how unusable this app is compared to the Red Cross’s Hurricane specific app. I hope by next hurricane season someone can rewrite this code or just copy and paste everything from the old apps that worked into the code for this app.   This app is a major step backwards from the Red Cross’ previous disaster-specific labeled apps. Unfortunately, I am forced to migrate to this app instead of using the Hurricane App that has been an incredible and almost vital weather app for someone living in FL with family in other parts of the state, some along the coast, some inland. I can no longer accurately monitor their safety, which is bad enough, but I can also no longer ACCURATELY monitor my own location. Despite setting alerts for my current “Live Location” and my Home location (which were both identical before, during, and after Hurricane Idalia) my live location showed no alerts. My Home location had 6 (4 of which were identical) but other weather apps correctly displayed what information I needed. For some reason, users can no longer set a location on the map, then receive alerts based on thar location. The app now uses zip codes and/or other ways to set geofences for location based alerts. My zip code is huge. Often what applies to the northeastern part is wildly different from my actual location. However, this app does not even attempt to filter relevant information. It’s also very difficult and complicated to navigate the app. Information vital to my survival used to be a tap or two away in the Hurricane app. Now? I will often navigate where I think something would be found, but it’s just not there, so I spend a lot of time, wasting a lot of battery, using a lot of data trying to access information. I truly wish the developers of this app had just copied and pasted the previous apps’ coding into this rebranded/unified/whatever app. Please look at the reviews flooding in (pun not intended) about how awful this new thing is… and how it’s even worse when comparing this app to the previous Red Cross disaster apps. Let me implore you to consider improving this app by returning some of the most basic and easily implemented features to the users.","1"
"458","Emergency: Severe Weather App","I don’t like this new weather app. I have family in several locations & states but must type zip code or name to open their location. Living in Tornado alley as l do, the time may come when l have no time to reach them. This App is difficult and confusing. I don’t want to give it even 1 review star.  2nd complaint:  l have critical alerts on 2 towns. How do l delete them when the threat is past?","1"
"459","Emergency: Severe Weather App","In the past few hours, my area has had Flash Flood Warnings and Heat Advisories. Not one notification came from this app. Stick with weather and news apps.  (And yes, all the alerts are set.)  07/22/23","1"
"460","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This application has serious issue with repetitive alerts. I never had this issue with the tornado app. Everytime you clear the alert it pops up again you may get 20 alerts for the same thing. This is very frustrating when you are trying to compose anything on your smartphone. The issue is worse on android phones.  Crapplication total poshware! Should have fixed these issues before mandatorily requiring customers to change from the old app.","1"
"461","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Good app, but it’s based on counties not zip code radius. It would be great to triangulate your most used locations. I drive in 3 counties. If I set my home location it gives me info for an area that’s 2 hrs away that is not helpful. If it were added correctly I could have saved myself 2.5 hrs of driving thru rivers and falling rocks yesterday.","3"
"462","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app sounds terrific, and time will tell. Had an issue when adding locations via zip code. (I.e. zip code for Goode VA came up as some place in a totally different state). So gave up and just input actual town names. That worked well. I’ll come back and review again once it’s been tested.","3"
"463","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Used to be able to put in location address and person to be notified with Tornado App, now can only put in a zip code add range 1.0 miles or greater. Not having the ability to identify the person and address is disappointing.","1"
"464","Emergency: Severe Weather App","In the tornado app, I could monitor family members based on their current locations using phone numbers.  I could also set a location using an address and then set a radius around that address.  This will only let me put in a zip code and it sets a monitoring area.  Well, our home is right on the edge of that area, so what do I need to do, set another area with a zip code near me to get that area near me monitored as well? That’s ridiculous.","2"
"465","Emergency: Severe Weather App","My son was on a flight flying through thunderstorms and tornados. He didn’t arrive to his destination.

I am Thankful and grateful to this app alerting me there was a weather issue at his destination. He was unable to land and flew back to chicago in between the storms. I wish I could share my snapshots to show you how grateful i am.  God Bless the makers of these Red Cross app. I was a volunteer in the flood of 1998 and from 2010-2015 i wish more people were aware of this app. I monitor my loved ones. It sends alerts. I am Thankful. The older tornado app is the one who sent the alert. I am a bit disappointed they will be discontinuing the tornado app. I love it so.","5"
"466","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app notifies you of everything! I set it to only warnings with in 1 mile of my home yet it gives me the whole county & the only time I need that information is if I’m traveling. I just Got a Vegas center report for Barstow and while I do live in SB county I live 87 miles away on the other side of the Cajon pass. I also get Vidal junction notifications out of Phoenix and I do travel that way to Az a few times a yr. Vidal junction is 175 miles away.","1"

"468","Emergency: Severe Weather App","This app has been a great asset for my husband and I. It gives us a lot of information along with the alerts we need.Just one thing. If the font background for the full alerts could be darker it would make them much easier to read - or make the font darker. Thanks!","4"
"469","Emergency: Severe Weather App","Great idea, if the app were useable.  Suggestion: have the developer sit down with a few users and see how to make the app user friendly.  Example: after adding the first zip code and contact, it's impossible to get back to the main page to add another location and contact. ?? Seems like a very basic and necessary function.   Is it possible that the app isn't designed to work on an iPad Pro?","1"
"470","Emergency: Severe Weather App","UPDATE: the latest app update corrected the crashing problem. The much anticipated new features are much appreciated and work flawlessly.   -------- EARLIER: I was thrilled to read the description of the most recent update, as it addressed many if not all of my concerns and then some.

"2","USDA FoodKeeper","I find this app really helpful.  The only thing I wish is that under each meat it had a tab for how long raw meat will last in the fridge before cooking, a tab for how long it will last once cooked and a tab for cooking information.  Right now it has two of those tabs.  One with how to cook the meat but I am not always clear weather the meat is raw or cooked regrading self life storage information.  Having a clearly marked tab for each with shelf life info for both circumstances would be even more helpful. Thank you! LP","4"

"6","USDA FoodKeeper","This is a great resource for food perpetration and storage. The Internet is full of varying opinions on the temperature of pork or how long an egg dish can be refrigerated. This app is a great resource to find the answers to those questions from the experts, the USDA.","5"

"8","USDA FoodKeeper","The latest update makes the app look unprofessional and amateurish, like some kid’s project.

"11","USDA FoodKeeper","The app appears to have stopped updating food recalls.  They are on the website but not showing up in the iOS apps. There’s no way to send feedback through the app to alert anyone of issues.","1"
"12","USDA FoodKeeper","The USDA website has been updated but not the app?!","3"
"13","USDA FoodKeeper","Every time I wish to share a food recall on FB all it does is “Share on your time line” than a fill in box with “http//“ at the beginning - it’s 2019, not 1980, it is possible to do this better.","1"
"14","USDA FoodKeeper","I really want an app to keep track of what food I have and when it will go bad. This could be the app I want if they change one major thing - I do not want to add every single item in my fridge, in my freezer, and in my pantry to my calendar! It needs a separate internal calendar or even better a searchable list arranged primarily by expiration date. It would be great to be at the store and be able to look up whether I have milk and, if so, how much and how soon it will expire. That would be a five star app.","3"

"18","USDA FoodKeeper","The app gives good info as to how long you can store various food items.  When it tells you to refrigerate the food, I wish it would tell you what temperature and humidity it should be stored at, esp. vegetables.  From experience certain vegetables like a slightly higher temperatures and different humidity levels than others.  Update: the problems people have been having with this app, me included, was a result of a problem with iOS 10.0.1.  The new version of iOS 10.0.2 takes care of the problem and now works just fine.","4"
"19","USDA FoodKeeper","Not impressed. Half of the things in my kitchen aren't even listed.  It has very little information about the ones that are listed and some listings are unclear. E.G., potatoes - in the pantry 1-2 months, in the refrigerator 1-2 weeks...what?  Wait...do you mean instant in the pantry and fresh in the fridge or are fresh potatoes good longer if left out of the refrigerator?  Obviously not. But it should be easier to comprehend than this.  (Not everyone has as much common sense as I do.) 😋 I can get better, clearer, faster information by just googling what I need, when I need it.  No need for a useless app taking up space on my phone.  Deleted.","2"
"20","USDA FoodKeeper","Let's take an example, mayonnaise.  If I am raiding the fridge for a midnight snack, I need to have some solid info.  If I discover the date on the mayo is old, I need to know if I can use it on my sandwich, otherwise...dry sandwich.  Sure it is past the date, but will it make me sick or is it just going to lose some flavor?  Here Food Keeper cannot really help.  It has like 15 words on mayo.  The app I currently use called Still Tasty has the basic info followed by a page of details, including how to tell when foods are really dangerous, and info about best by dates, etc...  The point is when it comes to food, it's a sin to waste it and even worse to get sick from it.  Who has the time to deal with food sickness and at midnight I am not going to market.  Food Keeper just does not provide the info I need.  Basically, it is just way too simple and leaves too many unanswered questions.","1"
"21","USDA FoodKeeper","This app states that it will give the information of how to properly store food to maintain freshness but all I can find is how long to store food. I wanted tips on proper ways and tips to store to the food to get the best freshness and longest lasting.","3"
"22","USDA FoodKeeper","I love the idea of this app and would give it 5 stars, but it doesn't work. When I download it it works fine, but if I go off the front page for any reason it stops working. The same thing happens if I close the app. Everything stops working. I even tried uninstalling it and reloading it twice and it happens every time. There is no app support, even though I followed the link from the App Store, so I thought if I wrote a horrible review I might get some sort of response!","1"
"23","USDA FoodKeeper","This is a great tool to have on any phone, it explains storage times and gives cooking tips for everything in my kitchen. I'm surprised how much I use it, and the photos it uses are really pretty. They make me want to cook more!","5"
"24","USDA FoodKeeper","Thanks for this useful food directory USDA! When deciding on the appropriate amounts of food to buy in order to save money and prevent waste + manage the timing of when they should be eaten this app is invaluable and convenient! No one likes moldy or sour food!","5"

"26","USDA FoodKeeper","Very easy to use and contains such helpful information. Thanks for making this!","5"
"27","USDA FoodKeeper","This app ignores the expiration or sell by dates on foods. I find it highly unlikely that any U.S. based company would open itself up to lawsuits by labeling a food as safe well past the dates given in this app (e.g. I've routinely purchased whole chickens and prepared them well after the 2 days post-purchase that this app suggests is the latest safe day to cook it).","1"
"28","USDA FoodKeeper","Feature request: How to identify the best produce.   Farmers market available in my area.","3"

"34","USDA FoodKeeper","After the last update the app doesn't work. Every food I search for isn't there and I can't open the categories to browse. It used to be a decent app, but now it's useless.","1"
"35","USDA FoodKeeper","App interface is slow and slow to respond.  Easier to search online and bypass the app.","1"
"36","USDA FoodKeeper","No organic options or options for things that actually go bad at a regular rate! Most of the things on here include preservatives so they'll last forever. Stupid app.","1"
"37","USDA FoodKeeper","Very informative. A must have app.","5"
"38","USDA FoodKeeper","Launches briefly, then crashes immediately. This continues after multiple efforts. Deleted the app.","1"
"39","USDA FoodKeeper","Please fix the crashing issue!","1"
"40","USDA FoodKeeper","Now it crashes every time. Please fix?","1"
"41","USDA FoodKeeper","On an iPhone 6, running iOS 10.3.1, I have had no faulty issues with the app running to date. But I do have some ideas to make the app better.   It's all fine and good to know best freshness dates, but what gets me to look for when I can eat a food that's been hanging around too long, I'm more concerned with not causing illness, diarrhea, rash, acne, etc. When is the 'must dispose' date? Demonstrative pictures would be helpful.   When cleaning out my pantry, I inevitably find canned goods without 'use before' dates. Instead they generally have cryptic numbers that I can't solve. Explaining this/these number system(s) in the app would be very helpful. Perhaps the ability to scan that number (or type it in, if it's barely legible) and the UPC would be helpful in that regard — and let the app tell me if it's usable.   Another feature that would be a benefit for buying food is knowing what to look for in each item to find the freshest and most flavorful foods in the store. Any given food item could be well past its freshness or lacking flavor before you purchase it.   One thing I noticed that leads me to think it could be missing for other items is added comments that need to be included. Items that contain aspartame don't mention that improper storage (over 80°) will kill its sweetness instantly. That wasn't mentioned in the diet soft drinks section and I'm sure in other areas that it applies. Other comments, like the maximum time for leaving foods with mayonnaise unrefrigerated (like at outdoor picnics/parties) are also necessary to know.   And, some foods (like inexpensive fish), have been known to be sold as counterfeit for more expensive types, to illegally increase profits. Show us what to look for at the market, so we don't get ripped-off.   It also would be a good idea to include a link to the poison control hotline, because stuff happens.","3"
"42","USDA FoodKeeper","App not working. When you open it , it shuts down.","1"
"43","USDA FoodKeeper","The font colors don’t adjust for anyone using dark mode. There must be some code you can add to fix this.","3"
"44","USDA FoodKeeper","It doesn't contain a lot like shrimp and fish. Useless","1"
"45","USDA FoodKeeper","Add farmers markets!","2"
"46","USDA FoodKeeper","Version 1.00 of this app contains much helpful info, but it is very slow, and crashes on iPhone 4 with iOS 7. It's supposed to have a calendar feature to help you keep track of when your purchased food goes bad, but I couldn't find it. The interface is easy to use and attractive.","3"
"47","USDA FoodKeeper","I would like to see in addition to them having a code on the Items. Then they could alert when things are found with salmonella or other bad things that are recalled. Other than that this is really great app.","4"
"48","USDA FoodKeeper","Does not provide true safety dates for food. We all know that we should eat food asap after purchase, but also that consume by dates are not hard & fast. That's why food banks give out food passed those dates.This app seems to list minimum date after purchase, not the science about when food is unsafe to eat. I appreciate the government supporting this app as part of an initiative to eliminate food waste, but please provide more safety information.","1"
"1","Emergency by British Red Cross","The first place I head to when adverse weather conditions are raised is to Emergency! Now a First Aid App has been developed which I am sure will be very helpful, even if never used a great benefit to have the information with you at all times.","5"
"2","Emergency by British Red Cross","It’s a great idea and in principle very handy. I like the way you can monitor multiple locations at once if you have friends or loved ones living away from you; and the quick link to message them to warn them or check they’re okay is helpful.  The only issue is the notifications don’t always come through; despite having all notification settings in the app and on my device turned on.   Unless you’re in the habit of regularly checking the app, which to be honest is a bit depressing (who wants to live life constantly thinking; “I’d better check if there’s any bad weather warnings”?), you’re going to miss the alerts.  At time of writing the app also needs updating to include the UK’s new Extreme Heat warnings.","3"
"3","Emergency by British Red Cross","I’m uninstalling this. My last alert was in Feb 2022. It hasn’t been set up to send any alerts concerning the heatwave which is disappointing. Also I increased the radius of the search area to 20 miles but it doesn’t save it and reverts back to 1 mile. I tried to add flood alerts but couldn’t successfully do it. The static info is useful but you can get that off the web. It’s a shame, it could be really good.","2"
"4","Emergency by British Red Cross","Absolutely wonderful app, keeps you updated with any emergencies happening around you and your family.  Only way to make this better if for it to have a companion apple Watch app.","5"
"5","Emergency by British Red Cross","If you are like me, you probably need a little more information to feel confident to  deal with an emergency. This App will save you time and give you the confidence needed by knowing the detail is in your pocket.  Hopefully you will never need it, but it’s good to know you can!","4"
"6","Emergency by British Red Cross","It's not ok to think you know it all, that you're up to date, that this isn't important. This app will be nearby and always worth a look through.","5"
"7","Emergency by British Red Cross","Great app, simple to set up alerts and so far has worked very well. Unfortunately needed quite a bit recently for foods alerts so it’s been great to have this.","5"
"8","Emergency by British Red Cross","I was really pleased with this app until recently.  Now I it shows me a weather alert notification but on opening the app again a minute later to check the details the alert is no longer on the main page and is not listed in the view all alerts list.","2"
"9","Emergency by British Red Cross","I have no problem in recommending this app The weather warnings to people who would do us harm I especially like the tips that it gives","5"
"10","Emergency by British Red Cross","Please consider adding polygon support instead of having to pick a place and adjust the radius. For work purposes it would be really handy for me to be able to monitor the whole of Scotland","4"
"11","Emergency by British Red Cross","Have to swipe left on iPad to access the buttons. Or hold in in landscape mode.  Works fine.","5"
"12","Emergency by British Red Cross","Great idea Red Cross. All the relevant information for loved ones in a handy little app. Easy to setup and monitor. Thank you.","5"

"18","Emergency by British Red Cross","Really useful","5"
"19","Emergency by British Red Cross","This used to be a good app but since I updated my phone I’ve stopped getting weather alerts","2"
"20","Emergency by British Red Cross","Useless for your area if you're in the southeast. Why tell me that there's an alert for my area when it's for totally different areas?!","1"
"21","Emergency by British Red Cross","Prepare everybody great app","5"
"22","Emergency by British Red Cross","I already have the First Aid app by British Red Cross so I was intrigued by this one, it's a clever idea. I walk a lot and I also have a couple of vulnerable relatives living a few hours from me, so it's great for keeping an eye on them, especially with the volatile weather recently. It looks very clean and it's really easy to use. Well done! Note - couple of people complaining of crashes below, I haven't had this problem, so assume it's fixed in the update.","5"
"23","Emergency by British Red Cross","This is a great app to get push notification alerts when a situation (eg flood, snow, etc) is likely in any of your saved locations (including your current location).   Works perfectly on my iPhone 6. Maybe those getting crashes need to try a reinstall.   Highly recommended app.","5"
"24","Emergency by British Red Cross","I live next to a river that is notorious for flooding, and the alerts have been absolutely reliable. The added feature of severe weather warnings is helpful.   This is the sort of app that makes buying an expensive smartphone worth every penny.","5"

Thank you Mario","5"
"27","Emergency by British Red Cross","As an emergency planner as well I would definitely recommend this app. It's great for getting people to think about preparing  for emergencies and keeps them up to date with the latest emergency alerts","5"
"28","Emergency by British Red Cross","Highly recommend. You can either add people, or places to monitor. Supports all kinds of emergencies. Some other reviews haven't looked at the app properly - give it a whirl!","5"
"29","Emergency by British Red Cross","It is possible to add multiple locations and change the survey radius around the target area. Appears to rely on your contact list to select names, so you may need to update contacts to add new names, could do with a direct entry mechanism. Look forward to seeing how the tool develops.","3"

"81","Emergency by British Red Cross","Good to be prepared","5"
"82","Emergency by British Red Cross","This is the app to have if you want to know about emergencies. No doubt when the BBC ends its association with the Meterological Office, I'll be depending on it more than ever. Until then, the BBC Weather app is quite good for weather, sunrise/sunset that sort of thing.","5"
"83","Emergency by British Red Cross","Great app, but please update it. As at 10/2019, on iOS 13.1.1, it contains various bugs, for example:  - from Alerts, Places, “Who lives here” if you select a contact, you can’t return to the app.  - from Info, if you select “Rate this app” it goes to a dead http address. (iPhone 6S)","4"
"84","Emergency by British Red Cross","No issues","4"
"1","First aid by British Red Cross","I downloaded this app as I seen it while looking for something on the Apple App Store. This app is brilliant I have done first aid in the past but never kept it up to date, while knowing most of the answers it was great to have a refresher. I highly recommend this app especially to those that have never learnt first aid, this could help/save so many peoples lives. It could also help those that have children maybe this way it could keep A&E waiting times down for minor injuries that could be treated at home.","5"
"2","First aid by British Red Cross","This app is more for preparing for emergency situations rather than accessible for use during them as in an emergency it's best to just call 999 and follow their instructions, but it's good to have information anyone can access to prepare and plan, and it's a good app for people who are anxious or paranoid about these situations to feel more prepared and to ease anxiety.  One big issue is that the sidebar really needs to have a button to activate! When I opened the app it was just a screen saying learn about first aid and no directions as to how to find the information or open any sidebars or panels, not a single menu button in sight! After ages of tapping and swiping I finally found that you need to swipe to the right to open the menu/sidebar, but that is a really poor design choice considering people might turn to this app in emergency situations.   Please can the makers just introduce a menu button or something to direct users to the sidebar, or a tutorial - anything to make it more clear on how to start using the app than just opening up on an almost blank page with no clear signs on where to go!","3"
"3","First aid by British Red Cross","Whilst I have done first aid courses in the past, it is easy to forget things.  I have read this app whilst on holiday as a refresh (it only took 15 minutes).  I think everyone should have this app,  Apple should automatically have this on their apps as standard.  It is simple, concise and easy to use.  Even my children would understand it so I have asked them all to download it and read it.","5"
"4","First aid by British Red Cross","Great app! And the other children version one, but can you maybe try and merge them together? Because then you just have one big app, please add it in the big update thank you!🙏 and also good that you don’t have ads, otherwise while someone is dying, and you need to save them, an ad comes up about games or other apps 😂🤣🤣","5"
"5","First aid by British Red Cross","Just been on a first aid course and memory already a bit hazy on a couple of things. Have revisited app this several times and will continue to do so to keep things fresh. Have recommended it for use at work.","5"
"6","First aid by British Red Cross","This is a fantastic app and I feel confident that I can deal effectively with a first aid incident knowing that it is on my phone.  However, to make it more emergency-friendly, a search function would be useful. I recently had to treat someone for shock which as far as I can tell does not feature on the app (it should!). I was able to quickly diagnose the problem but wasn’t then sure how to treat it. In this Situation a function that would allow me to search the app for a specific diagnosis would enable me to quickly find the necessary treatments.  So: - add shock and how to treat it - add a search function  Otherwise, this is a fantastic app and everyone should have it on their phone!","4"
"7","First aid by British Red Cross","I could not focus on the images, they looked similar in the tests. Being in a wheelchair knowing the right procedure is not easy to accomplish. Especially if I was on my own. The smartest thing to do is call 999. Not fluff around wasting their life, dial 999 first stick the phone on speaker talk and listen to the operator. That action would save lives.  I thought the recovery position was for unconscious people.","3"
"8","First aid by British Red Cross","The app is a good idea and I am at a loss why so many people think it’s amazing. The issue is there is not enough information on each topic. Not enough visuals. No enough examples. And simple things like dealing with a cut or graze which may seem obvious is not included. Cuts and grazes can lead to sepsis and you would be surprised how many people don’t know what to do or what to look out for when they get infected.","3"
"9","First aid by British Red Cross","Easy to use, clear instructions, helpful Q&A. I’m finally able to easily check my memory whenever I want to, which helps to keep the knowledge fresh in between certifications.","5"
"10","First aid by British Red Cross","Some advice out of date such as suggest a spacer for asthma inhalers is used by children or adults with poor technique.  Tests for bleeding is good revision, but disappointed that I can’t find tests in other areas.  Also disappointed at how how many links to other apps or videos etc there are, making it too time consuming to use effectively.","3"
"11","First aid by British Red Cross","I've just found this - I think it's a fab app which helps you to learn at your own pace. You never know when it might come in useful. It's easy to use and gives you instant feedback.","5"
"12","First aid by British Red Cross","Thankfully I have never had to use this but I do browse it and test myself every now and then. It is very easy to navigate, contains a lot of good information and lots of shortcuts so in the event of an emergency time can be saved (as well as lives).","5"
"13","First aid by British Red Cross","Very excellent good app. This always useful for home and work very helpful and educational app too. Always think of first aid and this app is very good for elderly parents as we get older cuts and swallowing gets harder so chocking and cuts can occur too.","5"
"14","First aid by British Red Cross","Absolutely flawless! If everybody had this on their phone, the world would be a better place. It's so easy to refresh your knowledge during down-time, and the emergency feature means even a novice can help!","5"
"15","First aid by British Red Cross","Wonderful app. Content is up to date, easy to find and convenient. Easy to understand. Fantastic to be able to refresh my knowledge between courses with the tests.","5"
"16","First aid by British Red Cross","Why would you not put a search bar at the top on the opening page? It would be handy in emergency situations. For example, I had no idea where to look when my family member had a potential eye injury.","3"
"17","First aid by British Red Cross","I recently completed the BRC Fist Aid course and downloaded both of their apps relating to adult and child first aid. Both are very well produced, easy to understand and more importantly easy to use. The revision test is a particularly good feature. 5 stars from me.","5"
"18","First aid by British Red Cross","Helped me refresh my first aid knowledge quickly and easily - everyone should have this.   Side note: On iPhones with no home button the slider in the tests can be hard to operate because it triggers the swipe motion.","5"
"19","First aid by British Red Cross","Simple and to the point. Great for those who have never attended a first aid course and a great reminder for those who might have forgotten a few things! Thank you so much","5"
"20","First aid by British Red Cross","A very tidy and well thought out app with up to date advice on what to do in a number of key medical emergency scenarios. Handy to have in your pocket for sure.","5"
"21","First aid by British Red Cross","Have just done a First Aid course but feeling like a “newbie” I have been using this app to keep everything fresh in my mind.  I can read it wherever I am- bus stops, waiting at appointments etc","5"
"22","First aid by British Red Cross","this app is great, it tells you the information you need to know if someone is in pain. This has helped me one time when my friend was choking, I was able to help her.","5"
"23","First aid by British Red Cross","It appears to be stuck or crashes every time I launch it. Sadly the app does nothing apart from say “learn” on a grey screen. Nothing on that screen responds to anything I have done, so unless it’s very well hidden it seems broken on my iPad. I assume it meant to do more than that, but no, not for me. I did refuse to let it send me notifications, so perhaps it’s sulking?","1"
"24","First aid by British Red Cross","This app should be included on every smart phone. The information is required reading and having the app handy to refer to in an emergency is priceless.","5"
"25","First aid by British Red Cross","This is a really good app the only thing that lets it down is a couple of the sections where there is a test at the end, the tests themselves can’t be completed because the multiple choice answers aren’t available meaning I’m unable to complete and pass the tests!","3"
"26","First aid by British Red Cross","Really useful to brush up your skills. Looks like it would be fantastic in an emergency. The most inromative and easy to use app for learning first aid that I have seen. Well done.","5"
"27","First aid by British Red Cross","Very useful information and quick learning using the app , very satisfied. Thanks","5"
"28","First aid by British Red Cross","I’ve done first aid courses in the past, but this app supplements them perfectly and gives you a greater sense of confidence to deal with any situation that arises. Can’t rate it enough, great app!","5"
"29","First aid by British Red Cross","Not only does it teach you “every” possible scenario that could happen. It test you and award you with a Badge. Great fun, whilst learning to cope with everyday possible emergencies. 10/10.","5"

"31","First aid by British Red Cross","The animations, especially about chest compressions are fantastic. Everybody should have this animation available, infact it would be better if all phones came with this advice and animation preinstalled.","5"
"32","First aid by British Red Cross","I love this app but wish it was a bit more in depth. Such as showing how to do emergency tracheotomy and re-setting of bones. Why?  Because you never know if you are going to be alone with someone who needs your help to that extent.","4"
"33","First aid by British Red Cross","I have been first Aid training for my position as a construction manager for many years. This App is a brilliant, an easily accessible comprehensive Aid. Top draw. Well done keep up the good work.👍","5"
"34","First aid by British Red Cross","Had the app for a long time, just went to use it and it no longer has features to search or to remind you. As we all know when you are first aid trained, it can be a while since you might need to use the training so a pocket help book on the phone is perfect.","1"
"35","First aid by British Red Cross","This is a must-have app everyone needs access to!","5"

"57","First aid by British Red Cross","I’ve decided to stick with the St John’s Ambulance app because it’s clearer. Eg bleeding minor or severe and if severe to treat for shock too.   I’ve always been told an AED stops the heart to allow it to restart itself but in questions it talks about restarting the heart.  My neighbours convinced I am wrong due to the app implying this.","1"

"96","First aid by British Red Cross","Having just downloaded this app, I must congratulate the programmers on an excellent lesson on writing in simple speak, easy to use, fast access to life saving information, excellent videos, instant access to need to know, and further access to nice to know. Instant dial access to 999 within the program, nice touch and totally completes an excellent app, I usually like to suggest an improvement, in this app I cannot. I think a previous reviewer has got it right when they suggest all manufacturers of apps based phones should have it already installed on their phones and i further suggest that the manufacturers make a generous donation to the red cross for the service. If you feel the same way start the ball rolling and send a donation to the red cross for this excellent app, I did","5"
"97","First aid by British Red Cross","I recently took part in a work related First Aid training course run by the British Red Cross. The course was very informative and at the end we were told of this app. It's a great way to refresh your knowledge. If you haven't had any First Aid training before then this app will give you plenty of information that could help you save someone's life. Not only does the app give you vital information, but it also has tests to revise your knowledge with achievements available for getting full marks which encourages you to learn more! I'd advise everyone to download this app and learn some basic live saving skills!! 5 stars!!","5"
"98","First aid by British Red Cross","As somebody who has received a fairly significant amount of medical training in the past I found this app to contain a surprising amount of technically correct data and content without it feeling 'bloated'.  Some reviewers have mentioned that additional content pertaining to tourniquets and pressure points should be included. Whilst their observations around the effectiveness of these techniques is correct, let's not forget that this is a First Aid app and NOT a medical text book. I guess the line about 'content' has to be drawn somewhere.  There are 3 developments that I'd like to see in this app  1. A 'social' function that would allow small chunks of selected content to be shared with others.  2. The ability to input an emergency number into this app so that an emergency call can be made from within the app itself, rather than having up leave the app to make a call.  3. Some form of geolocation functionality would add benefit, especially when coupled with the above suggestion.  I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't want this app on your mobile device, in fact download if now and then recommend that your family and friends do the same!","4"
"99","First aid by British Red Cross","This is definitely a brilliant app. Well made and presented with the user in mind. But could be a lot better. The info is very basic. In the bleeds section for example, it just says keep the pressure and add more dressings. Well what if you have a catastrophic bleed and direct pressure isn't working. How about indirect pressure. Knowing how to do that will saves lives and it's really simple if you know how. That's a common theme. Give people more credit to learn. On the CPR theres little mention of putting breathes into your casualty, again really simple. It says do it if you feel up to it. Well are we trying to save a life or not, I mean don't put yourself out too much? Getting air in the blood around the body is a priority, but let's add some air too.","4"
"100","First aid by British Red Cross","Cannot express enough how essential this app is. Even if you are not trained in first aid, you could be the difference between life and death by having this app at hand. Easy to absorb the information, test yourself on the information you have at hand and be able to make the difference by following the step by step info. By using the Emergency button, get quick guides and the emergency number at hand ready to call for professional help at the tap of the screen if required. By far the best app available, and a definite must have.","5"
"101","First aid by British Red Cross","Every iOS device should have this app. It uses simple language and has excellent video tutorials embedded already - so no Internet connection is required. It's also super fast to navigate and is aesthetically very pleasing indeed. The test yourself is something that everyone should stop right now and take, you may very well use those 5 minutes of learning to save someone's life in the future. Can anyone think of a possible better use of 5 minutes?   Well done BRC. Hopefully youll continue to add scenarios, videos and details. An excellent start!!!","5"
"102","First aid by British Red Cross","This is just brilliant!!! It's crammed with easy to understand info that it so simple - quite refreshing from other first aid I have learned in the past!  If I came across a first aid emergency now I would feel confident that I could help! The images are clear and really help you to picture the scene and the animations really help you to 'get it' and understand how and why you are doing what you are doing. I would recommend this app to everyone- and will do!!! It will be great to know that all my friends and family will know how to help if anything ever happened to me!! Well done Red Cross!!!!","5"
"103","First aid by British Red Cross","As a qualified first aider for a number of years, this is great as a guidance. Anyone could use the emergency section even if they're not trained.  Someone (Doctor Smiles) mentioned about part of the sections being incorrect for the unconscious not breathing and it not stating about mouth to mouth. It does say 'if you are able to, then do so' under the FAQ's of that section.   Great app, highly recommended. Read the FAQ's of each section to get further info if you're not sure of things before you judge/review this app!","5"
"104","First aid by British Red Cross","Fantastic app to have all you need at click of button not only can you read learn and discover but test yourself to see if you ever find yourself in a situation where you will require assistance in life saving its all there and if regularly looked at and practiced it will become 2nd nature at what to do just wish could give more stars also good to show kids it's like a little game but there brains like a sponge and take in the infomation and will be able to help someone if ever require never to young to learn cheers BRC","5"
"105","First aid by British Red Cross","Omg had a first aid training today the guy knew nothing, suggested we help angina sufferers to take their medication paracetamol so i said I think ya meen aspirin that has warfarin like blood thinning properties he also said that a heathy body dumps excess sugar into your urine...... OMG if you have sugar present in your urine you are one sick little bunny, anyway rant almost over just to say this, looking through this ap was 100% better than the training and anyone with this ap will learn more than anyone did in that training","5"
"106","First aid by British Red Cross","While this app is very informative, there are some omissions which need to be addressed. E.g. With bleeding there are some situations (severe / arterial bleeding) where tourniquets are advisable, and as long as they are used properly, there is no reason why they shouldn't be used. In some situations it may make the difference between loosing a leg or a life. Indirect pressure is another technique which has been left out. While this is a very good app overall, and will doubtless save many lives, there are some topics which need including.","4"
"107","First aid by British Red Cross","This app is great for refreshing your first aid knowledge such as the test facility,  if you have some knowledge/training already. If you don't, it is great guidance in an emergency situation. Best first aid App I have found so far by a long way! My only gripes are no instruction on shock treatment/recognition, and not many updates come through. But all in all, definitely worth downloading 100%. Since ios 9 came out, my test knowledge function doesn't work in the app.","5"
"108","First aid by British Red Cross","Please get, I got this app thinking I won't need it ... But I was wrong! I was walking the dog when my daughter ran to the swings In the park and fell over and broke her leg! She was in so much pain, I couldn't think what to do? I had called an Ambulance but in the mean time she was so upset I quickly got the app out and looked up to do with a broken leg! It helped a heap you think you won't need it but you may need to!","5"
"109","First aid by British Red Cross","Brilliant. Educational, and fun. My only suggestion would be add a couple if features. How about adding an emergency light. An audible alarm.  And some kind if location position info so if I were calling 999 I could give them much better location details? This app could be turned into a fully encompassing emergency kit.","5"
"110","First aid by British Red Cross","I've been looking for a good first aid app for ages. Thought I'd found it with this - well laid out instructions etc and easy access, BUT then it kept interrupting me telling me to complete my game data. It apparently links across to online gaming whether you want it to or not. I don't want it to but as a mere user I have no say in the matter. Actually I do - I can delete it. And I have. Pity though, it could have been so good if they had produced it as a serious app on first aid  rather than primarily a game…...","3"
"111","First aid by British Red Cross","This app helps prepare you for when someone has a medical emergency and needs support. Additionally the app doesn't require wifi so it doesn't matter when you need it. Also, as well as being able to learn, if you are helping someone it gives you a step by step guide. This is a great app especially for kids who won't have the training and who will play out.","5"
"112","First aid by British Red Cross","As a first responder for the ambulance service I found this app a perfect way to keep my knowledge and skills upto date! Even though it advises you the bare minimum to keep situation under control until someone like me comes along! It still keeps your mind ticking over on the basics!  This app is quick and effective to use and would be usable by any medical novice!","5"
"113","First aid by British Red Cross","What an excellent app. It's very well put together and covers all everyday emergencies as well as larger ones. The only thing I would add would be some for of audible alarm shouting for help and a location finder but that is just me being very picky. I have seen paid apps that offer less than this. I have to congratulate the Red Cross on this most excellent piece of work.","5"
"114","First aid by British Red Cross","Completed a first aid course a while ago and this app was recommended to me. This is worthwhile for anyone to download as it is so user-friendly. Lots of information, videos and short quizzes to help you understand how to apply first aid in a variety of situations. If you ever need to give first aid and aren't sure what to do, this app goes through it step by step. I highly recommend it!","5"
"115","First aid by British Red Cross","Really love this; never know when it might come in useful.  My only complaint is on the test tab - you click prepare and the question about flood preparations there is no right answer it says failed you need to move the vehicle to higher ground.. There is no option for that?! Fix this then perfect app!  Thanks","5"
"116","First aid by British Red Cross","I'm shocked that the Red Cross could give such poor advice. This app suggests you should give sugar in a diabetic emergency without establishing whether you are dealing with a hyper- or hypo-glycemic condition. This could be worse than doing nothing and could even be fatal!  This app should NOT be used by those who have not done a first aid course. If you are a competent first-aider this may be OK to keep your skills refreshed but you MUST refresh your skills with face to face tuition, not using an app. So 3 stars as a revision app but it needs updating urgently.","3"
"117","First aid by British Red Cross","I can't recommend this app enough! The emergency button is a genius touch, excellent for a situation where panic might make navigating an app difficult!  Just have one issue, I've completed the challenges but am struggling with the preparation one; I've selected call the flood line and given it the red tick but it still says I've got the answer wrong and I should call flood line ","5"
"118","First aid by British Red Cross","One of the best apps I've ever downloaded. A potential life saver!   After cutting my finger with a knife I used this app!! It really did help.   This app has lots of really useful features. Including both learning about first aid and then it has the ability to test me on it!!! :) I've know got to knowledge to go a head and earn myself some first aid badges!!!","5"
"119","First aid by British Red Cross","Great app love the tests and this is good for everyone becuase it is potentially life saving advice in the test for the man thats just come out of the pub though the recovery position looks wrong though i thought you put the arm over on the opposite cheek thats what my nan said any way and she was a nurse so does everyone else that taught me any way well done great info and easy to use this app","5"
"120","First aid by British Red Cross","I think this app has been designed really well. In just a few minutes reading through the short, easy to understand sections I have more confidence and feel I am more likely to step in in an emergency situation.  Even if you don't want to sit there and learn it all in your free time, or you think you'll forget, the app is really easy to use and extremely clear and in many situations if you were the only available person you could very quickly refer to the app and see what you need to do. The links to call 999 are also a great feature.  I'm positive this has and will help people and save lives!   Well done and thank you!!","5"
"121","First aid by British Red Cross","The life-skills taught in this app are well-presented through videos, diagrams and text.  The  self-tests are a useful assessment tool. The app was recommended to me by my First Aid  trainer.  I am very grateful for this handy means of review that can be used repeatedly.   I hope to reinforce and consolidate the learning from the one day BRC First Aid training course I did so that I can confidently and effectively respond in an emergency situation.  RA W","5"
"122","First aid by British Red Cross","This is literally a life saving tool. I love the way that there is an option for if you are in an emergency you can get help easily (includes timers when needed, links to phone 999). I was so glad to find out you don't need Internet access as I have an iPod touch and can only get Internet with wifi.  Great app for comfort even if never used. Highly recommend.","5"
"123","First aid by British Red Cross","Loading the app with 500MB free on an iPhone4 gives an insufficient space message. The emergency button leads through to a long list of conditions with no useful diagnosis path an. App frequently crashes or displays blank pages.  Given the status of the Red Cross, and the importance of the subject matter, more effort should have been put into designing and testing this. In its current state, the app is likely only to cause delay & panic in an emergency situation; currently, it may be useful for studying first aid, only if the app's space and blank page issues can be resolved.","1"
"124","First aid by British Red Cross","I have just finished a three day first aid course with the Red Cross and this app is a perfect way to recap and help to remember some of the things I learnt. For anybody who doesn't know the first thing about first aid it's a wonderful tool to have just in case of an emergency. The information is so simple to find and then quick to access - I'm very impressed by the whole thing.","5"
"125","First aid by British Red Cross","I already had a first aid app on my phone but this one is so far ahead of any others out there. The information is clear, up to date and most importantly simple to follow. This app is not just about what to do if something happens, it's also brilliant at helping you avoid injury in the first place! Well done British Red Cross, finally First Aid advice from someone we can trust!","5"
"126","First aid by British Red Cross","Completed a first aid course over 6 months ago and this app was recommended for me to use. Believe it would be a much needed support in an emergency situation. Also, it is reassuring to recap on different areas through the different quizzes available. Will be keeping this app on both my iPhone and iPad and would recommend it to anyone to use.","5"
"127","First aid by British Red Cross","This seems like an excellent app. Aggelia should get their facts straight before using such dramatic language. Giving sugar to someone who is hyperglycaemic WILL NOT be fatal (not unless you intend to force-feed them sugar over a long period). High sugar is a long term problem only. Low blood sugar can be fatal within a very short space of time. The advice given by this app is therefore correct.","5"
"128","First aid by British Red Cross","Being a first aider myself this covers most basic first aid emergencies and gives excellent advice that anyone can use. The only improvement/change is to include the 112 emergency number as well as 999, recommend everyone installs this app - you never know when you might need it (but hopefully not :-) )","5"
"129","First aid by British Red Cross","Excellent app which is just the thing for learning and checking. Just two faults: the tests could change slightly to ensure you've understood the basics not just  learned the test. And on my phone the hospital finder brings up the details on the hospital below not the one you tap. This means the nearest hospital never comes up. Ok at home where we know the answer but no use away from home.","4"
"130","First aid by British Red Cross","This is a must have app you'll never know when you need it, also it's great to top up your knowledge, having done a first aid course earlier in the year, and you keep up with the changes of first aid. Overall I would say downloading this is a must as it has everything you need to know.","5"
"131","First aid by British Red Cross","Just glanced back to this today & was surprised to see good video guides very simple to follow, I'm a first aider at wrk & have not been given follow up training so will read up more with this easy to use app.   A must for everyone even if you only use it once that's one more life helped or saved. 😄","5"
"132","First aid by British Red Cross","The app is very helpful but when I am doing the tests i can do bleeding to prepare but after that on some the pictures won't load so there is no way I can pass the tests and some the tests just wont load at all fix this and the app will be amazingly great and I will be able to learn more and later one test myself to see if I can remember it all and also some if the badges don't work so you can't see what tests you have done","3"
"133","First aid by British Red Cross","Must say i loved this, so easy and simple for anyone at any age to understand, a pat on the bak who designed it! Just one thing tho, trying to answer the 'prepare' section telling me im not selecting the correct answer on the floodline question, tells me the answer which i put but still says im wrong... Still 5 stars tho!! Love it!","5"
"134","First aid by British Red Cross","I attended a Red Cross first aid course yesterday, which was excellent by the way, and one of the teachers mentioned this app. I got home and downloaded it, I like it a lot! There are all the essentials (obviously) such as how to use first aid to help in an emergency situation and there are also useful quizzes to do to check your understanding and knowledge.","5"
"135","First aid by British Red Cross","Congratulations have to go to Red Cross, who by giving this app for free are living up to their core goal of bringing life saving skills to the widest audience possible. Some other first aid providers want to charge you for their apps.   Now there is no excuse for not carrying with you the knowledge which you may need to save a friend or family member one day   Core first aid skills broken down into logical sections - very easy to use and a quick aid memoir if you need to refresh your memory.  This should become the most downloaded app of iTunes very soon , as there is no excuse not to download it.   Thanks BRC, much appreciated !","5"
"136","First aid by British Red Cross","By chance, I downloaded this app on Wednesday.  The next day I found myself giving CPR to an unconscious man in the back of a speeding taxi.  He'd been hit by a truck and stopped breathing.  Thanks to this app, he was still alive when we reached the hospital.  There is no reason, no excuse for you not to download this right now.  Don't be a helpless bystander.","5"
"137","First aid by British Red Cross","Clear, concise and easy to use. Currently completing a first aid course so this app is wonderful along side my learning. Helps test yourself to make sure you know what to do in an emergency. I'd recommend for everyone to download this app because even without a qualification in first aid it will give you the necessary instruction in an emergency.","5"
"138","First aid by British Red Cross","Although first aid trained, upon seeing a gentleman struggling for breath and clutching his arm one day, I suddenly couldn't remember what to do in the event he was suffering from a heart attack so I searched for an app as soon as I could and found this one. It's outstanding: so easy to refer to quickly with clear, easy to follow directions.","5"
"139","First aid by British Red Cross","This app is brilliant! It works on both IPhone,IPod and IPad. It's a must have! Get it now,you could save a life! You can get achievements in there,it tells you all you need to know about first aid and how to give it,it has games,quizzes and fun facts. This app is really worth it,every bit.","5"
"140","First aid by British Red Cross","Just completed the first aid course with the british Red Cross and think this app is fantastic! Easy to use, user friendly text and great little tests to keep you up to speed! I'd highly recommend and would even say the pictures/videos could help children in cases where parents are unwell!","5"
"141","First aid by British Red Cross","What a brilliant app. Difficult to spot where any improvements can be made. I think the errors reported by some are slight ignorance, the car answer is incorrect, not a mistake. I've had no issues at all, got all the badges from the tests!","5"
"142","First aid by British Red Cross","The BRC team really understand mobile design and have built a very user friendly app. It's full of useful information and i love the little touches like the quizzes and awards. Can't believe it's free! Everyone who downloads it should donate a little something.","5"
"143","First aid by British Red Cross","This app is by far the most intuitive and easy to use first aid app on the app store. The navigation and design makes it easy to find things quick in an emergency. Hope I never need to use it but knowing that I don't need internet access to get the first aid info in an emergency is a great comfort.","5"
"144","First aid by British Red Cross","I would consider this app essential to everyone, it has a easy to use interface, clear and informative instructions on how to handle any medical emergency, big or small. It will help save somebody's life if you have this app!","5"
"145","First aid by British Red Cross","Clear, concise and instantly available wherever you have your phone - everyone should have this app. At the least it will reassure you in an emergency, as it did me today when my 11-year old tore his head open on a wire fence playing football. At the most it may save someone's life.","5"
"146","First aid by British Red Cross","Amazing App with everything we should all know, at the touch of a button, to help should we need to help someone. Even if you think you know what to do the details will give reassurance and refresh knowledge. The ease of use will enable young people to feel confident too!","5"
"147","First aid by British Red Cross","An excellent app, beautifully designed with explanatory videos. The emergency button is a great idea. For example, press it and have instant access to step by step instructions as to what to do if someone has a heart attack. With this app on your iPhone you may just save a life.","5"
"148","First aid by British Red Cross","For learning the basics and not being in those circumstances i prefer the st johns ambulance app but if i had to use it in an emergency then  id prefer this one. Also i enjoy the fact you could use the video on here which is good for visual learners.  but whichever app they are both amazing charities and deserve a hell of a lot for the thousands of lives they save!","4"
"149","First aid by British Red Cross","I am a qualified first aider at work in the construction industry with what I consider a very good memory but in an emergency situation who knows if I or any one could recall the right information a must for all devices and a great confidence booster to help you know your doing the right thing at the right time","5"
"150","First aid by British Red Cross","Lots of information yet not overwhelming, the capacity to tell it 'I'm in an emergency right now' so that you can get more focused information... It all adds up to a very well thought out app - very happy to have on my phone for emergencies and reference.","5"
"151","First aid by British Red Cross","I have just finished a work related First Aid Training Course where we were referred to this app,it has fantastic features and step by step procedures incase of emergency with a test feature to refresh your memory and challenge yourself! More than useful and a must have","5"
"152","First aid by British Red Cross","Excellent app, easy to use, simple, quick and could save a life in an emergency. Definitely worth downloading. I would happily pay for this. I'm a trained first aider however if I wasn't this app would help so much. Even though I do have some training this is great to refresh knowledge.","5"
"153","First aid by British Red Cross","It would be great if no one never had to use this. But that's not the way of life. Download it and you could save a life or give help to someone. The test is good. You probably know more that you think. Well done.","5"
"154","First aid by British Red Cross","In the diabetes emergency treatments, there is a reference to insulin pens that could be inferred to mean that an insulin shot can be administered to treat hypoglycaemia. This is absolutely incorrect and reference to insulin treatment, inferred or otherwise, to treat hypos should be removed. Insulin reduces the blood glucose level and it's use could be deadly in this case. Always give something sugary by mouth.  Otherwise, an excellent app.","4"
"155","First aid by British Red Cross","Deffo worth this free app. Full of handy info in case of an emergency. It will also guide you through a step by step way in to saving lives.

"159","First aid by British Red Cross","I completed a red cross first aid course for work reasons and this is the bible that reminds me of all that good information. I'd imagine it would be great in an emergency. I read through it occasionally to keep up to scratch. Much thanks to the people who created this!!","5"
"160","First aid by British Red Cross","D'loaded as its free and I really hope I never need to use it - but having so much info at ur fingertips can only be good. If you have children or look after the elderly it'll be worth having. You can also donate to the Red Cross through it & read about the Red Cross.","5"
"161","First aid by British Red Cross","I have recently attended a 1 day British red cross first aid course and found this app a great addition and reminder of the course.

"165","First aid by British Red Cross","Very good for refreshing your memory, having recently done a first aid at work course, I felt something like this app would be perfect for testing your knowledge and build confidence at the same time.","5"
"166","First aid by British Red Cross","Great but when you prepare yourself there is a question asked last what do you do if there is a flood warning, the answer is to move you car/van to higher ground but when you try and answer it there is no right answer needs to be sorted out.","4"
"167","First aid by British Red Cross","A clean, simple, easy to use design and a definite purpose. I learnt valuable lifesaving information from this app. I have gone on to do first aid courses and donate to the Red Cross. Just think how many lives this app alone can save.

Helpful to see the situation acted out. Thank you.","4"
"174","First aid by British Red Cross","Helpful little app. It's very easy to understand how to perform the first aid, it has a good teaching style and explains reasons for doing things and  Love the little tests. Just a shame that when I try to share things it doesn't work!","5"
"175","First aid by British Red Cross","There's not many apps out there that can save someone' life but this one most definitely can. What more do you need to know, download it as heaven forbid it could be a loved one who you have to save.","5"

Check out the info icon to learn more from BRC. This app took a while to come out but well worth the wait.","5"
"183","First aid by British Red Cross","This is an awesome app, but for suggestions i think in the emergency part, you could list a few symptoms so if you didn't know what the person was suffering from, you'd know! Thx","5"
"184","First aid by British Red Cross","Just attended another 2 day refresher course and found this app really useful. It's at your fingertips when dealing with a situation it's quick and easy and helps the training to come back.","5"

"193","First aid by British Red Cross","For info of aggelia below it is taught to give sugar in a diabetic emergency as low bloody sugar is much more dangerous than high therefore giving sugar to someone with high sugar will do less damage than leaving them to slip in to a coma through low sugar","5"
"194","First aid by British Red Cross","Colleague at work collapsed and had a seizure in front of me today. Wish I knew about this app before as I would have been much calmer/confident in helping him. Download, read and take all the tests.","5"

"196","First aid by British Red Cross","I have done a first aid course and found this app very helpful as a reminder of what I learnt. Definitely worth having, whether or not you already know some first aid.","5"
"197","First aid by British Red Cross","Overall a great idea but a few key points missing, I just did a first aid course and some of this advice is outdated, including:  - we now check inside the mouth before tilting head back and checking airway - otherwise you may send an obstruction further down their windpipe!  - you should use a cold, damp cloth for head injuries, not an ice pack - you can cause accidental damage by over-chilling the skin from the neck up  - you should run burns under tepid water for 10 mins, not cold, because the cold can send a person, especially a child or baby, into shock.","3"
"198","First aid by British Red Cross","This app is brilliant. It is very clear and understandable with useful videos. This would be very handy if you are in an emergency situation. If it can help save someone's life then don't hesitate to download it.","5"

"200","First aid by British Red Cross","Very simple clear and practical information which will and has saved lives! This app should be on everyone's phone.","5"
"201","First aid by British Red Cross","I think this app is spectacular because if these emergencies happened in real life and you didnt know what to do you could just find the app and find out what to do","5"
"202","First aid by British Red Cross","Superb app, full of useful info and the Emergency section is great when you are faced with a situation and your mind goes blank..  One of the best First Aid and emergency support app on the App Store, if you only download one App then make sure it's this one..!!","5"
"203","First aid by British Red Cross","Absolutely brilliant app. My parents told me to download it since I'm a student in uni, the emergency feature is extremely useful should I ever need it. This should be pre loaded on all phones.","5"
"204","First aid by British Red Cross","This app is really good even for younger people.  It's really confidence boosting and helpful. I would recommend having a feature on helping someone who is drunk/taken drugs too as it would be useful, apart from this a really good idea to have it as an app:)","4"
"205","First aid by British Red Cross","Great app in every way. Simple, up-to-date advice. Very user friendly. Lovely high definition graphics encourage use. Self testing function provides confidence and opportunity to gain in knowledge. Thank you British Red Cross.","5"
"206","First aid by British Red Cross","This App is so very good for providing advice just when you need it. First Aid tests are a fantastic way to test yourself.   But please bring back the hospital finder, that was a benificial way to find the nearest hospital.  I work at various sites, so knowing I could find the nearest A&E could be useful, so rated as 3 stars rather than 5.","3"
"207","First aid by British Red Cross","Has the potential to be an excellent so that everyone should have.

"1","Hazards – Red Cross","Good idea but needs improvement.   I tried the knowledge tests and got stuck at the wildfire one because the answers to the test questions do not match the order of the questions.   Also with the “I’m safe” section we should be able to choose which contact number to use for a person. There is no point in trying to send a text message to a landline!","2"
"2","Hazards – Red Cross","When I go and check the alerts page there is a weird error message that keeps popping up every few seconds and it doesn’t stop. Very annoying when I’m actually trying to scroll to the relevant alert to read.   Also, would be handy on the alerts scroll page to know when the alerts are issued without having to click into the individual alerts to find out (or at least list them from oldest to newest). During an emergency, updates come in thick and fast as the situation unfolds and reading outdated civil defence information could be dangerous, if not life threatening, if evacuation plans (or other emergency management efforts) change significantly.   The idea behind this app is commendable. But please fix the bugs and keep the app in good nick so it’s good to go in an emergency. Thanks!","3"
"3","Hazards – Red Cross","Started out well giving relevant warnings for where I live and display the list of family and friends I added in various locations, so I would know how if they were facing any hazards. Then suddenly it had my location as all sorts of weird places. I went to settings to see check everything and was informed it was downloading updates which it has seemingly been doing/attempting for three days. Not remotely helpful, especially when it freezes on this screen until I restart my phone and the whole circus starts again.  Disappointing.","3"
"4","Hazards – Red Cross","I don’t like being negative but this app is currently not fit for purpose. Today I received two alerts about high winds and torrential rain based on Met Service weather watches/warnings issued 17 HOURS prior. So the alerts were far from timely. But what’s worse is that, assuming they had been issued yesterday, the period covered was a calm and dry day in Auckland with a gentle Southerly, which is one of our most predictable weather patterns. So I just can’t believe that Met Service would get that so wrong. I have to infer then that the app just isn’t working properly / the Met Service feed has gone barmy. The app causes unnecessary concern and I finally deleted it today. Avoid until seriously upgraded.","1"
"5","Hazards – Red Cross","I was out on the harbour in my boat, basking in full sun with slight winds.  The App was alerting me of thunder storms which put a dampener on the day due to, ‘what if’. We played it safe, made our way back to the marina, and cut the afternoon short, only for the amazing weather to continue, and no sign of Thunder storms almost 24 hours later.  I’ll continue to use this App. I’ll take the information with a grain of salt, but use the alerts as a cue to do further digging myself.","3"
"6","Hazards – Red Cross","I’ve been using this app for a few years and for about 2 years I got notification of any event that is happening but the past few year no notification is coming through. I have checked my phone and app settings and everything is set to on and to receive notifications, I uninstalled and reinstalled and still not. Thinking of using another app. Unless this gets fixed. Please let me know","1"
"7","Hazards – Red Cross","Started off strong, but now no alerts or warnings come through. I had no idea about the current severe wind warning until gale force winds hit my house. Disappointing this app isn’t delivering on its one sole purpose. Have triple checked all settings and nothing is out of place","2"
"8","Hazards – Red Cross","This app is a great idea but the system behind it is hopeless. We just had a violent storm in Auckland and the app gave zero warnings ahead of time. The first word was the day after to tell us the storm had happened and people were cleaning up.  It's always bugging me about trivial rain showers but said NOTHING about a major storm with 120km/h winds. It's usually mute about tsunami warnings too.  I hope they can get this right but not expecting much based on experience so far...","1"
"9","Hazards – Red Cross","Edit. What use is this worthless app if it doesn’t even notify you when a 130km/h storm is hitting you!?   Developers. You are going to KILL people because of your incompetence.   Edit. Where were the notifications for the recent flooding, mini tornado, severe wind and storms !?!!  This app will kill people.  1) STOP USING CAPS!! YOU DONT HAVE TO USE IT TO MAKE A POINT!  2) Your font is terrible and hard to read. The formatting just has a few words per line.  3) I DONT CARE about notifications of issues in south island, central north island, uppoer south island, or other places than where I live (and set the area as). Stop bugging me with endless notifications.  I wish there were another app, or the Civil defence app is not decommissioned.","1"
"10","Hazards – Red Cross","My wife and I both have this app. It is random and unrelated whether she or I get notifications. They can arrive 17+ hours late. My phone will buzz and I get the lock screen notification, then drilling into the app discover the alert was issued many hours ago. I have complained previously with no real response. I only keep the app because it’s slightly better than nothing but rely on other delivery methods.","1"
"11","Hazards – Red Cross","App doesn’t do what it says .... a week of crazy weather in Auckland and not one pop up notification ... but if you open the app the alerts are there. Even after double checking notification settings, uninstalling and reinstalling... still no notifications popping up ... are we supposed to open the app each day and check? Bring back the Auckland civil defence app!","1"
"12","Hazards – Red Cross","Don’t bother getting this app. If you want to know what’s happening in respect of hazards in your area, this app wont tell you. It’s just full of blurb about how important Red Cross is - which in respect of warnings and dangers, it is not","2"
"13","Hazards – Red Cross","Good app but currently unusable due to errors due to fetching data ? Error 416","5"
"14","Hazards – Red Cross","I never get a notifications sent to my phone, I’ve tried setting up warning etc and nothing happens what a waste of space app! And yes all the notifications settings on my phone are correct. The is just bad very bad","1"
"15","Hazards – Red Cross","Just received a warning (Monday Labor Day) for severe storms dated Saturday. This app cannot be relied on in a real emergency in its current state but I will wait and see. It’s important in NZ to have reliable information especially in the South Island.","3"
"16","Hazards – Red Cross","Whenever I try to open the app it says that it’s going to download some files. This didn’t happen before and there is no explanation what files it tries to download","1"
"17","Hazards – Red Cross","I used to get the notifications but a phone upgrade and reinstall of this and I now get NO notifications. A check of settings has shed no answer. Pity.","3"
"18","Hazards – Red Cross","Terrible , unreliable , very poor functionality . Bring the old one back .  Alerts either don’t come thru or come through after the threat has passed ! Never receive any alerts despite all settings being set up correctly   HAPhazard more likely","1"
"19","Hazards – Red Cross","Not straightforward to find your way around. Also shows my location on the map miles away from my true location which minimises its usefulness.","1"
"20","Hazards – Red Cross","Won’t even open the main page, download ssl connection issues. I’m on wifi and every other app works. This one seems broken?! When it starts working I will amend this rating accordingly.","1"
"21","Hazards – Red Cross","The App never sends notifications-yes I checked everything.","2"
"22","Hazards – Red Cross","Very disappointing not to have received notification via this app to prepare for last night’s extreme weather in Auckland. This should have been the one place to receive warnings and yet nothing was provided.","1"
"23","Hazards – Red Cross","Never receive warning for you local area in your map, but the get several day late warnings got something that happened on the other island s few days ago.  What a joke of an app.","1"
"24","Hazards – Red Cross","Persistent issues with push notifications (unable to register) with no fix available. Please rectify.","1"
"25","Hazards – Red Cross","Serious weather happening around northern Auckland with no notifications, the app won’t even load when I open it. Need to fix this bug ASAP","1"
"26","Hazards – Red Cross","This is just awful. Pairing up with the Red Cross was a bad idea. This should be independent. My alerts come after the event and it feels more like an advertising platform than the essential piece of kit it's supposed to be","1"
"27","Hazards – Red Cross","Unfortunately I have received alerts, three at a time, every few hours for severe thunderstorms in my area, that are simply not occurring. As the other reviewer said this results in unreliability and overstimulation.","1"
"28","Hazards – Red Cross","Downloaded this app and all I get is a blank screen. When I previously had this app it never seemed to notify me - what gives?","1"
"29","Hazards – Red Cross","Never receive any alerts despite having all notifications turned on.","1"
"30","Hazards – Red Cross","Ended up uninstalling because the notifications are frequent & annoying (& you get two notifications every time even with only one location set up). It's like the boy who cried wolf & you end up ignoring the ACTUAL hazards. I understand their predicament because of they don't warn about something & someone gets hurt they get the blame. What it needs is a sensitivity level setting 1-3 where 3 (the default) means it warns you of everything, 1 means it only warns you of the UNDOUBTABLY critical hazards for your location. With the current options you can only disable a particular hazard type altogether, which you don't want to do.","2"
"31","Hazards – Red Cross","I’m still not getting any notifications. I’ve posted very similar reviews for several versions now.  Notifications are turned on. Sound is turned on. Phone is turned on. I got the warnings, just not from the app.  It makes it pretty pointless really.","1"
"32","Hazards – Red Cross","The alerts generate an error message, the app is currently useless","1"
"33","Hazards – Red Cross","Doesn’t work keeps coming up with errors","1"
"34","Hazards – Red Cross","This app is useless, worse, it’s dangerous for people who are relying on it to send alerts (as it claims it will). Fix the bugs Red Cross, before someone dies as a result of your incompetence!","1"
"35","Hazards – Red Cross","This is not working and could be more of a danger than help. Fix it or remove it from the store.","1"
"36","Hazards – Red Cross","Terrible. No notifications of any of the recent or current storms.","1"
"37","Hazards – Red Cross","The newspapers are buzzing with Tsumami warnings and this app does not have any alerts/warmings about it whatsoever.  Pointless if it does not work...","1"
"38","Hazards – Red Cross","I keep getting an error that reads thunderrequest https error 416.","1"
"39","Hazards – Red Cross","This app has been very responsive and alerting, easy to add locations of whereabouts you want to be alerted at. Also gives you lots of relevant information to read about when you are curious, the information is also helpful because it tells you how to prepare for the situation, how to treat the situation, and how to deal after the situation, it is also quite easy to turn off the notifications you don't actually need for hazards like rain or wind. I would give this app 10/10 as it is sharply integrated with all IOS 10 and 9 devices.","5"
"40","Hazards – Red Cross","Had to get this app as previously Brilliant Civil Defence app closed. Yesterday there was a Major earthquake. I live on the east coast. By the sea. So. Where was the tsunami warning??????  Why wasn't this app functioning as we were led to believe it would. I'm Constantly getting double Alerts for south island weather when I'm in the top of the north. Which is totally useless. Programme needs to be far more selective and only issue relevant warnings. Lesson learnt tho. I will never rely on it to warn of a disaster in my area.   As well. The auto GPS location is well out. But this is a google maps fault as well. Very irritating.","1"
"41","Hazards – Red Cross","Can't manage alerts as described - no option to do so for a location (despite the info section stating that this is where to manage alerts)","2"
"42","Hazards – Red Cross","Ok, so up until now, I hav had warning in my area for weather. Probably a good thing to be warned about. However today there was a full civil defence worning going out for the north island following a 7.1 earthquake for tsunami. It was enough to shot down the train system on Auckland. However, I had no warning through the app. WT? So for some rough weather (fairly typical in winter) I get bombarded with warnings. But if it has the potential to be a real civil emergency, not a peep. I have one little warning for pssible earthquakes.","1"
"43","Hazards – Red Cross","The location of our place as recorded by the app during the initial startup process is incorrect, though the description is ok. There is no way to change it to show the correct location. This, in case of emergency, can lead to serious problems if the rescue used the map to locate our place.","4"
"44","Hazards – Red Cross","Awesome app. Not sure which category terrorist threats would come under though! Also, some of the quiz questions and answers need reviewing as they don't quite match. But still good idea to have that feature.","5"
"45","Hazards – Red Cross","Yes, I know it's raining. It's been raining for the last 2 days. But thanks for the repeated notifications, most of which arrive within seconds of each other with the same information!   I got this app in the hope it would alert me to anything serious that's relevant to where I live. But alas this is not the case. I fear for the people that actually rely on this in places around nz that are troubles with earthquakes and similar hazards. Time to remove the app...","1"
"46","Hazards – Red Cross","My phone won't support this new app, guessing lots of people we have the same problem, so making things unsafer for most. Also the test yourself is not working properly, question 2 where to build a house re land slips.. Keeps saying I'm wrong even when I have copied the correct answer.","3"
"47","Hazards – Red Cross","A great app, a work in progress I hope. I got a tsunami warning from a quake in the Solomon Islands just moments after I had heard on Radio New Zealand that it had been called off and hours after we first heard about it on the radio.","4"
"48","Hazards – Red Cross","What's the point in putting in your location an having the gps running if this app gives you alerts for the whole country? Plus the text/font is ridiculous. If it was a proper emergency then it would be more time consuming reading it than getting to safety.   Please fix this to be considered worthwhile. The old civil defense app was far superior.","1"
"49","Hazards – Red Cross","Terrible app. At first I got no warnings. Nothing. Nothing for a major earthquake and tsunami threat. I played with a few settings and now all I get is weather warning after weather warning. No new ones but duplicates warning. Often a day past the issue date. Meanwhile my wife gets none at all with the same settings. Full of bugs and inconsistencies.","1"
"50","Hazards – Red Cross","What have you done to the app. So many warnings are coming up and they are so difficult to read. I feel like deleting the app. Reminds me of the cry wolf story. I'm now ignoring the warnings, as there are so many and I can't find what is relevant to me. So you are missing the point.  All I want are: decent alerts and to be able to find my family in an emergency.","1"
"51","Hazards – Red Cross","This app is nowhere near as good as the previous one.  I get loads of warnings for heavy rain, usually after it has occurred.  Today there is a tsunami warning and there are no alerts for my coastal Auckland location!  Also as someone else mentioned, too much writing when there is an alert, it makes it difficult to quickly see what's going on.","1"
"52","Hazards – Red Cross","Too many alerts. I have my setting correct but recently its alerting several times a day for rain/thunderstorms/winds that never eventuate. A real cry wolf situation here. Sort out your localization please as now I ignore your alerts and will remove the app. Its like when you hear a car alarm, too freqent and too many false alarms.","1"
"53","Hazards – Red Cross","This app has warned me repeatedly at least 10 times that there will be strong winds in Christchurch. I got it the first time, I really don't want to shut off notifications for wind but this is really really annoying and it worries me that when there really is a hazard coming that I'll just ignore it. Like the boy who cries wolf. Please fix this.","1"
"54","Hazards – Red Cross","The ability to delete old alerts is needed. Something that is 5 months old (even days, or sometimes hours) is of no value.","3"
"55","Hazards – Red Cross","I've lost count of the number of times I've setup my monitored locations in this app only to come back a few weeks later and find it's all been forgotten.   Better just to sign up for text alerts and turn on Twitter notifications for your local Civil Defense.","1"
"56","Hazards – Red Cross","Severe weather warnings when I've turned them off due to most not being relevant. No warnings when I might actually need them. Hopeless. People have been complaining about these things for months and no update to the app. Red Cross, find a new product manager.","1"
"57","Hazards – Red Cross","Highly recommended for those in NZ but also for those overseas who have family/friends in NZ","5"
"58","Hazards – Red Cross","CDEM used to post Met service severe weather warnings but since having to change to this app I have yet to receive any alert if any kind - notifications are enabled so I don't know if it is an app problem or config fault","1"
"59","Hazards – Red Cross","Super helpful and not only will it warn me I can read up about things to be aware of.","5"
"60","Hazards – Red Cross","Good App but cannot seem to delete warning once read which is annoying.","4"
"61","Hazards – Red Cross","Just want simple alerts such as storms, volcanic eruptions, strong wind, heavy rain etc.  What's with the stupid questions. Stick to the facts your not a quiz show or game, stupid overlays as well they really don't add to the app.","2"
"62","Hazards – Red Cross","An app you actually need to work, and it is rubbish. Counterintuitive and incredibly hard to navigate. Have gone from receiving hourly rain forecasts to getting no alerts for actual earthquakes. Come back Civil Defence - you were a thing of beauty.","1"
"63","Hazards – Red Cross","This app either warns of weather events after they've happened, or more commonly warns of impending doom which doesn't happen at all. Talk about crying Wolf! Bring back the old Civil Defence app before people are killed or injured due to the misinformation","1"
"64","Hazards – Red Cross","This app is frustrating with its near-constant notifications. I don't need to be warned that there's a little bit of rain on its way - save the notifications for actual hazards like cyclones and volcanic eruptions. Not impressed.","1"
"65","Hazards – Red Cross","Warning all the time about a little bit of rain here and there, but nothing about earthquakes and tsunami warning,  this app in not help at all. I don't want To go to Facebook to get the civil defence news, I will prefer it on this app.","1"
"66","Hazards – Red Cross","Please Red Cross do yourself a favour and get some proper app developers! When you need information and alerts you don't get them and when you don't, you do! This is trivialising a really serious matter.","1"
"67","Hazards – Red Cross","Completely useless notification system. Pushes unnecessary warnings, the same one up to 4 times, for minor weather events. If the point of the app is warning people, this is the way to NOT do it.","1"
"68","Hazards – Red Cross","Keeps crashing the phone, and is very resource hungry. It takes over the flash light function, meaning you can't turn the light off from the swipe up menu.","1"
"69","Hazards – Red Cross","I need to change my email address and I can't using the app. Pretty basic functionality I would have thought.","1"
"70","Hazards – Red Cross","Awesome app. Would be great to be able to monitor more locations than 5.","4"
"71","Hazards – Red Cross","Absolutely useless! Tsunami warning non existent today. Actually no warnings at all. Sort it out! May as well delete it, I got more information through Facebook.","1"
"72","Hazards – Red Cross","Excessive irrelevant and hard to understand weather warnings. What's the people function? How do I add people to my map? Bring back the old app with simple clear event warnings I actually needed to know.","1"
"73","Hazards – Red Cross","As others have said, the same warning arriving 9 times within one evening. Annoying and a joke. Civil Defence app was great - what on earth happened?  Please do something about it!","1"
"74","Hazards – Red Cross","Bring back the old app ! This one is not targeted at all - I receive storm warnings for every part of the country -  yet I am still waiting for the tsunami alert issued this morning.","1"
"75","Hazards – Red Cross","I'm based in Hawke's Bay and this app perfectly tracks my location but still for whatever reason getting notifications for rest of NZ","1"
"76","Hazards – Red Cross","Myself and 4 work colleagues have the app set to advise of tsunami warnings - we just had a major earthquake off East Cape and a tsunami warning issued - none of us received an alert.","1"
"77","Hazards – Red Cross","Very hard to read the text, alerts are from a different part of the country. Not a good emergency management app at all. Much preferred the now defunct civil defence app.","1"
"78","Hazards – Red Cross","I can choose a location, but not choose any alerts for it!","1"
"79","Hazards – Red Cross","Great if you didn't actually want to hear about any CD testing or disasters in your area or worldwide for that matter. Best to just use a cabbage instead and ask it if it's ok.","1"
"80","Hazards – Red Cross","Bring back the old civil defence app. This thing is so useless today, no tsunami alerts and no news events. Twitter is more useful than this, sad!","1"
"81","Hazards – Red Cross","This is a great idea. However I've been trying to set up the I'm safe message and it won't let me select the number I want to send it to. It automatically selects a landline.","3"
"82","Hazards – Red Cross","Great idea but I don't want notifications every time it rains or blows!  Only want notifications of serious stuff like previous hazard app did.","1"
"83","Hazards – Red Cross","This emergency app's performance is so poor compared with the old CD app. My settings are the same as my wife's but she does not get alerts sitting 1 metre away......  Fix it CD?","1"

"94","Hazards – Red Cross","The text in the alerts is hard to read no paragraphs. Horrible font.  Alerts cover the hole country not my local area.

"1","Alarm112","Z wysłaniem SMS podczas rejestracji to przesadziliście na prawdę...  1.

Zo staan de gegevens bij ‘Mijn informatie’ te dicht bij elkander wat het lezen niet zo eenvoudig maakt. Toch zeker niet voor de ouderen.  Op sommige iOS toestellen is de breedte van dit scherm ook net iets te groot.   Bij de ICE contacten worden de gegevens ook nogal rommelig weergegeven. Waarom is er plots geen spatie meer tussen voornaam en achternaam?!   Neen neen voor zo’n belangrijke app zijn deze foutjes niet te begrijpen. Het geeft alleszins weinig vertrouwen.   Ook het gebruik van de app laat de wensen over. Ik tracht ouderen te overtuigen van deze app. Maar wat gebeurt er *exact* als ze bv op het icoontje van de ziekenwagen tikken? Komt er nog een pop-up van iOS dat er getracht wordt naar een nummer te bellen? Wordt er meteen gebeld? Of komt er nog een ander scherm. Dit is niet helemaal duidelijk en ook niet via de video’s op de website. Ouderen willen precies weten wat er gebeurd. En niemand die het weet…effectief een nutteloze telefoon naar de hulpdiensten doen is de enige manier om dit te weten te komen.   Kortom. Wees aandachtig voor deze slordige foutjes en verfijn de app. Al maanden zit er ook een bug in waarbij de app bij opstart soms crasht en waardoor je deze opnieuw moet opstarten. Opnieuw bijzonder jammer dat zo’n bug in een betrekkelijke eenvoudige app maanden blijft zitten.","1"

Je m’attendais à quelque chose de bien plus scindé, de bien plus clair, (un peu à l’image de la fiche médicale qu’on peut remplir sur notre IPhone) quant à cet espace, à mon sens c’est essentiel quand ces informations peuvent être d’ordre médical, du coup je voyais plus un truc dans le genre :   Problèmes médicaux : Notes médicales :  Allergies et réactions :  Traitements :  Groupe sanguin :  Poids : Taille :  Médecin traitant :  Donneur d’organe : oui/non  Notes (autres) :   🤷‍♀️","3"

"1","PREP","現在位置が常に港区六本木です。 位置情報は常に許可しているし、トラッキングも許可してます。  ゆれくるコールの時から使わせてもらって活用していますが、刷新されたことでアプリを探しにくくなりました。 滅多に使うアプリではないのでただでさえアプリ名を覚えずらいのに、馴染みのない英単語を使うのはデメリットが大きいと思います。 また、アイコンもわかりにくいので、間違えてアンインストールしてしまいそうです。 前のナマズはカッコ良くはないけど、覚えやすかった。 とても有益なアプリだと思うのに残念です。","2"
"2","PREP","PREP時代　その後 星4↓ リニューアルからしばらく経った今、使った感想を書きます。結論は意外と使えます。情報がとても早いため洗濯物を取り込む用に入れています。外出している際にはリニューアル前のアプリであった「ゆれくるコール」で十分です。（どちらも課金をしないと現地の情報の通知が来ないため…）そのため「ゆれくるコール」はメイン端末、「PREP」はサブ端末に入れています。 このアプリのいいところはやはり通知がどこよりも早いことです。防災のアプリを他に2つ入れていますが、このアプリがやはり早いです。緊急速報（ソミソシレの音）よりも早く大変心強いです。 また運営さんの対応が素晴らしいです。利用者のニーズに応え、「ゆれくるコール」を復活させたり、通知できるものをカスタマイズできるようにしてくれたり、レビューに一つ一つ答えたり、、利用を続ける理由は運営さんの対応の手厚さにもあるのかもしれません。いつもありがとうございます。これからも使わせていただきます。  PREP時代　リニューアル時 星3↓  一昨日くらいまでアプリが開きませんでした。もう星一評価してアンインストールしようかなと思っていました…しかし昨日やっと開くようになったアプリを使ってみることにしました。まだ２日くらいしか使ってませんが、使った感想を書きます。 地震の機能だけではなくなってしまったので正直見にくくなったと思います。下にある選択バー？のようなところは分けられててとても見やすいです。 しかし「ライブ」の画面はすべての情報が順番に並べられているので見にくいです。警報や速報をアプリを開いた瞬間から見られるようにして欲しいです。絵のアイコンだけでは見にくいです。絵だけでなく文字でも書いて欲しいです。 プランやアクションはゆれくるのものを引き継いでさらにカスタマイズできるようになっていたのでこれはとてもいいと思います。大雨警報が出たら大雨のアクションを推薦してくれるのでわかりやすいです。焦っていてもなにをすればいいのかすぐにわかります。 通知についてですが、通知の種類を細かく分けられるようにして欲しいです。「激しい雨が降ります」の通知は私には必要がないので音が出ない通知にカスタマイズできるようにして欲しいです。 しかしやはり通知の速さは業界の中でもかなり早いと思います。本当に素晴らしいと思います。 これは多分私だけしか思っていないことだと思いますが、位置情報の更新がかなり遅いです。その場所にはもういないのに家に帰ってもまだその位置情報でその場所に対応した情報を早く見たいのに見れないので残念です。 このアプリはまだ生まれ変わったばかりなので期待を込めて星3です。これから良くなっていくことを願います。  ゆれくるコール時代　 星5↓  揺れが来たらすぐ教えてくれるし、しかもソナエ機能もあってとてもいいです。 北朝鮮の事があったので、ミサイルのソナエも用意してほしいです！","4"
"3","PREP","気象アプリは別のを使ってますし、というかウィジェットに対応もしていない気象アプリなんて意味のない…… 地震アプリであれば、ただそれだけでよかったんです だって地震アプリが欲しかったんですから。 有料音声の声優目当てで有料会員になっています。 でも試し聴きもできなくなりましたので、通知がくるまで聞くこともできないんですね。 あとタブレットで地味〜に使いづらさを感じているのが「縦表示しかない」こと。 ゆれくるは横表示ありましたよね？ タブレット対応と謳うなら横表示用UIも作るべきだったのではないでしょうか？ ゆれくるに気象アプリをプラスする、ならわかりますが、これでは全くの別アプリです。 残念です。改善を望みます。なぜこんな改悪アプリを作ったんですか？意味がわかりません。 地震をメインにして戻してください。 あとアイコンが無個性すぎてアプリの目的を全く表現できていない。  ***** 数分前に書き込みましたが、先ほど有料会員を解除しました。 何度考えても課金の意味がないと思いましたので。 これからナマズのアイコンに戻り、プレップ？とかいう目的のわからないアプリ名をゆれくるに戻し、使えないUIを改善することができれば有料へ戻すことも考えようかと思います。 今までありがとうございました。","1"
"4","PREP","GPS常時オン。 携帯各社の巨大な基幹局が1km以内に目視できる山の頂上付近に職場がある。少なくとも4Gは全社ともしっかり入り、山頂付近のためGPSの電波が拾えないとは考えにくい（ウクライナ戦争に伴い米国国防省が精度を落としている可能性はなきにしもあらずだが、他のアプリは50kmも誤差は出ていない）。  現在地の気象情報と称して行ったこともない見知らぬ50km以上離れた土地の大雨情報がアラームと共に出て、邪魔で仕方がない。そしてこの「現在地」は編集できない（課金すれば出来るのか？）。 先日、久しぶりに「現在地」とGPSが合致しアラームとともに「100mm/hの雨」と出たが気象庁レーダー画像は30〜50mm/hの雨雲が接近していたに過ぎず、20分間でほぼ上がり直近のアメダスでは8mmと記録されていた。 いったいどこのどのデータを引っ張ってきているのだろうか。 オオカミ少年になる前に削除した。  NERV防災をはじめ他のアプリやブラウザブックマークより気象庁のサイトを見ればじゅうぶん。見知らぬ土地の通知と常時GPSなど防災アプリとして電池の無駄で不適切設計。  初期の「ゆれくるコール」が懐かしい。","1"
"5","PREP","ゆれくるコールさんからのアプデでこちらのアプリに移管したみたいですが、悪評の中心は揺れくるコールとの比較なので参考にならず、別物と考えてます 私は東日本大震災から揺れくるコールを入れてますが、地震特化だったものが使い方が全く変わってしまったので、ついて行けないユーザーが居るのかなぁと。  このアプリの意義的には地震のみならず災害に対策対応出来ることを重きに置いた作り方なのかなと思いました、 若干、使いづらさ(お役所アプリっぽい)感じはあります、直感的ではなく機能をリストアップして並べてあるので、 自分が知りたい情報を並べ変えたり、マイページで一目で自分が知りたい情報がまとまって見る事が出来ればもっと良いかなと思いますね... 揺れくるコールが再リリースされているので「地震」という情報だけ知りたいのであればそちらを使えば良いので、 私はそのまま使い続けてます 声優さんを使った通知など意欲的な所は沢山あるので頑張って欲しいアプリです 今後のより良い改良に期待してます！","3"
"6","PREP","2022,05 エラーの連続、読み込みまずにフリーズの連続、必要な時に通知が来ず、災害時に確実に手遅れになるタイミングでポンと来たりする通知。 人命の助けになる便利なもののはずなのに、混乱を招くだけのアプリケーション。人を困らせるために作ってるのかと思うくらい役に立たない。これに関わって仕事してる人は恥ずかしく思うことを勧める。これを世に出して胸を張れる人間がいるなら対話してみたい。 史上最悪のアプリケーション。  -----以下、2021時のレビュー----- 勝手にアプリ名からアイコンからなにから変わって、いざ使ってみたら永遠と読み込み中、エラーの連続、地震情報だけ迅速にみたいだけなのに余計な表示ばかり、有料プランへの誘導が邪魔して必要な情報に辿り着けない。 さんざんテストして作られるはずなのに、よくこれをリリースできたものだなと思う。 ユーザーが情報を見れない時点で使う意味がどこにもない。","1"
"7","PREP","ゆれくるコールが復活したと聞いたので、prepは即刻消しました。 分かりにくいアプリ名と直感的でないアイコン。余計な機能で用途も分からなず、利用者を迷子にさせる余計で無駄な機能群。 精度の悪い速報。 悪いアプリの典型例かと思いました。 地震速報が必要なのに、肝心の命に関わる部分が使い難いのが致命的。 ゆれくるコールのように、もっとシンプルで分かり易い機能に分離して、個別のコールシリーズにして分割リリースして下さい。今軽く思いつくだけでも、雨くる、波くる、風くる etc... 個々に機能を分ける事で、機能別のニーズも解りやすくなるし、有料化するにもアプリ別にその機能に特化して拡張したほうが絶対に良いと思います。","1"
"8","PREP","ゆれくるか復活したのを知り、暫く併用していました。で、やはりこちらは削除しました。一言で言うと、全て中途半端。マシにはなったが、地震発生時にマップが開かない、遅いは継続。大地震の時に使えるとは思えない。天気防災は、yahooに比べても情報が少ない、通知は気まぐれかつ遅い。使えないので、通知オフにしてもいつのまにか通知設定になりなり出すのは、もはや腹立たしい。最後に評価コメント返答はAI自動かと思うくらいワンパターン。政治家みないな内容。地震機能を評価している人、ゆれくると比べて！。天候、災害関連は、既存の他のサービスと比べて！。ずっと良いのがほかにある！。","1"
"9","PREP","ライブ画面の現在地が自宅住所と同じになったままで固定です。 現在地の通知設定を初期状態に戻して再設定しましたが改善しません。 iOSセキュリティ設定ではPREPの位置情報利用を常時可能にしています。 アプリ設定の契約情報ではプレミアム契約なっていて毎月120円お支払いしていますが、地点1～3の設定にアクセスするとプレミアム加入の案内が出てきます。 通知センターのPREPのバナーからアプリにアクセスすると必ずエラーになります。 いったいこのアプリはどうなっているのでしょうか？","1"
"10","PREP","地震速報の来る震度設定は存在するが、動作するのは、その発生地点の震度で発生する。 つまり神奈川県で速報アラームを震度3に設定した状況で、茨城で震度3の地震が起きて、神奈川県は震度1だとした場合、アラームが鳴るってゆう仕様は理解できない。 なんで設定地点で震度1なのにアラーム鳴るの？","2"
"11","PREP","なまず君の『ゆれくる』から大型アップデートで『プレップ』となりゴミと化しました。 ただひたすらに使えない。  そしてなまず君復活したので、そちらをインストールしてこちらは消しました。 さよならプレップ。最後までしょーもないアプリだったね。","1"
"12","PREP","ゆれくるこーる以降、利用させてもらっていたが、アプリアイコンをタップしてもすぐ終了されてしまう。 iPhone本体の電源を入れ直したりして見ても症状の解消には至らない。 不具合解消されないので色々調べて見たところ、アプリのアップデートがあった様なのでApp Storeに行って見たがアップデートは完了しており、それ以上の対応策が見つからず、使えない状況にある。  今回の件でゆれくるこーるが復活していたのをApp Storeで発見したのでそちら側に移行も考えている。","1"
"13","PREP","天気は殆どの人が専用アプリで見ているのでメイン画面に天気は少し邪魔かなと思います。地震が気になった時にこのアプリを使っていますので。特にその地域の地震の履歴や間隔の傾向や、むしろ気圧変化と地震は関連していると思うので各地の気圧変動グラフと比較しやすいようにしてほしいです。各地の揺れ体感報告などは参考になり良いと思います。ついでに動物の異常行動とか地鳴りとかも気がついたら地点登録で記入出来ると今後に役立つのではないかと思います。 ゆれくる復活されたとの連絡ありがとうございました。","4"
"14","PREP","大きな問題があります。 何度も自分の場所を入力しようとしましたが、PREP が自分の場所を見つけることができません。 追跡を許可するように設定を変更した後、これは非常にイライラします。 これで問題は解決しません。","1"

"20","PREP","他の方のレビューを見ていると批判的なものが多いですが、そこまで酷くないと思います。通知の詳細設定をしっかりすれば頻繁に通知が来ることもありません、試しもせずにレビューしてる方はよく試してからレビューしましょう！ 私は外での仕事が多いので、雨雲や落雷などの通知も大変助かります！","5"
"21","PREP","「ゆれくる」から「プレップ」となり、災害アプリとしての質や情報の速報性が明確に低下してしまった。 災害情報アプリも増えいろいろやりたいのは分かるが、無理に総合アプリを目指した事で全てが半端になってしまっている。 地震速報に特化して質の向上をすべきだったのではないか。残念。","2"

"24","PREP","地震大国日本。なので、私的には地震がいち早くわかる方が良かったのだけれど。。。 地震の際の通知は圧倒的にゆれくるが早かった。 PREPは地震が治まった後に通知がくることの方が圧倒的。なので、ゆれくるを再インストールしました。 これはこれで他の災害カバー用ですかね。","1"

"29","PREP","ゆれくるコールの方がいいという前の意見もありましたが今ではアプデが多くなり、シンプルでより使いやすいアプリになっていて、文句なしです。ですがゆれくるコールの事なのですが、iOS13以降のOSだけ対応ではなく、iOS12の人も使えるように改善して欲しいです！","5"

"140","PREP","先ほどの地震ですら通知が一切ない。 話にならない。 ゆれくるだったら、こんなことはなかった。 こんなレビューを書いても、このアプリの運営は、定型文でしかリプライしないだろう。 ゆれくるに戻してくれることを期待して、１年間くらい様子を見たけど、１年で対処できないなら何年かかっても対処できるわけがない。 今回の地震で、他のアプリで十分に通話が来ることが実証されたので、このアプリとはもう今後関わる必要がないことが分かった。 命に関わる通知を出すアプリについて、今後改善しますの一言で済まそうとする運営は、今後何をしようとも信用できない。 ありていに言えば、命を預けることができない。 ゆれくる時代には命を預けても大丈夫だと思えたわけだが、prepになってからは無理。 これを読む他のユーザーに強く主張しておきますが、このアプリでは自分の命や、自分の大切な人の命を守れない可能性が高いです。 貴方にとって、大切な人の命を守れるアプリを選択されることを祈ります。 少なくとも、このアプリの運営は、人の命よりも、他の何かしらを守りたいようです。 だからこそ、prepの無能さ加減に対する多くの意見に対して、定型文でしか応答しないのでしょう。 このレビューについても、定型文で応答するのは目に見えていますし、応答する暇があるなら、技術的な問題を解決するために努力しろとしか思えません。  2/19追記 やはり定型文での対応が来た。それが癪に触る行為だと分かっていてても、他に対応する術がないんだろうな。 そもそも、調査のための問い合わせフォームを使って連絡寄越せ、情報寄越せと言ってる時点で話にならない。 通知が出るかどうかなんて、テストすりゃ分かるはず。 基本的なテストすら行えてないんじゃないのか？ どうせ、プログラムがオブジェクト毎に分けられていなくて、どこをどうテストすれば各部分についての問題の有無を判定できるか分からなくなってんだろ。 ゆれくると他のプログラムとを融合させるために、各オブジェクトの切り分けが崩れて、あっちを弄ればこっちがダメになり、何がダメかがもう分からない、というところなんじゃねぇのか。 そして、肝心のゆれくるのプログラムも、prep化した後に原型が失われたか、もしくはチームから外した技術者との兼ね合いで使用不可になったかして、ゆれくるに戻すこともできないってところだろ、おそらく。 まぁ、あれだけ有用だったゆれくるを、ここまでダメなアプリに変えた技術者しか今現在居ないのだろうから、テストもまともにできていないであろうことは、火を見るよりも明らかなわけだが。 原因がまったく検討もつかない異常が発生しているならいざ知らず、地震発生時に通知が出ないのは、原因となるものの当たりくらいつくだろう。 ユーザー側に情報提供を求めるなら、今自分達はどこまで解析出来ていて、どこまでが解析出来ていないのか、それをきっちり説明するのが筋だろう。 それをやらずに、情報が足りなくて改善できません、だから問い合わせフォームから情報をくださいってか。 ユーザーだって、どこまで解析されてんのか分からなかったら、的確な情報の上げようもないんだよ、そのくらい分かれ。 前にも書いたが、定型文書く暇があったら、もう少し何を成すべきか考えろ、馬鹿にすんのも大概にしろ。","1"
"141","PREP","I loved this app until it suddenly changed. I didn’t choose to update this app, it updated on its own with no warning or request from me and I can’t get it back to the old one. It now no longer supports/has English AT ALL nor is it easy to use if you’re not fluent in Japanese. I really loved the old app because it was simple, and even with occasional ‘weird’ translations it was a comforting app that gave information quickly. I hope the new app will include other language options in the settings and allow us to choose our language so that everyone can use it properly again. I will update my review if more language options are given back to us but until then, sadly my review is low. Maybe the developers didn’t realize how many people trusted their app before they changed it.","1"
"142","PREP","Update: this is really annoying. There is still no English version after, what, one year? If you have no intention to make Prep multi-language, but yet you are still running Yurekuru, why not make it available for everyone, including those people like me who upgraded to Prep before realising it’s only in Japanese-???  I read, once I had tried to download and start using Prep, that it would be better to keep Yurekuru if I want the information in English. Except... I had already started the switch. And my Yurekuru has disappeared... If you still have Yurekuru, why isn’t it possible to download it again, if we have lost it and cannot use the new Prep version? I feel much less safe without Yurekuru.","1"
"143","PREP","追記。アプリ立ち上げとデータ取得に5秒内外かかる重さ（読み込み中マークが消えて表示されるまでの時間）がまず最大の問題。Yahoo!災害速報はその半分以下の時間で立ち上がります。それで最初に出るのが位置情報を許可してください、のポップアップ。 問題は個々の「不具合」ではなくて、根本的なコンセプトにあるのではないでしょうか。どんなに端末が高性能になっても、機能てんこ盛りでグラフィックを入れたら重くなります。地震速報アプリは、独立して軽かったから良かったんですよ。Facebookだって、メッセンジャーだけアプリを分けたでしょう。フル実装だと重いしUI的にも使いにくいからです。The more, the betterではないのです。  今後どれだけ改善するかには興味があるので半年くらい入れておくつもりです。まず位置情報常時取得要求のポップアップを外し、画面上半分を占め邪魔なだけの天気のグラフィックを消すか数行程度に縮小して、ナマズのアイコンももっと目立つ色なり大きさに変え、それに加えて立ち上げが軽くなったら残すかもしれない。そうでない限り、私はRCSCさんの求める顧客ではなかった、という事でしょう。もし仮にリプライを頂けるなら、これらの点を今後変更する事があり得るかについて何かしら伺いたいです（定型文は不要）。  以下2020/9/12レビュー  今日の地震で、アプリが更新された事を思い出した。  ゆれくる時代は「地震直後に、開くだけで震度分布が見える」速報性を気に入って使っていたが（速報でなくてよければ気象庁のサイトを見るが、5分はかかる、その差）、更新されて仕様やレイアウトがやたら複雑化したばかりか、サーバに全然繋がらず情報が得られない。  天気やその他災害情報も纏めた総合アプリとして、使い込む課金ユーザーの開拓に期待しているのだろうが、地震速報アプリとしての機能を期待する向きにはマイナス。天気を見ないなら路線検索アプリ等と違い毎日使うものではないから、UIが直感的に分かりにくい、開いてまず出る画面に一番知りたい情報が大きく出ない（上半分が天気表示になっているが、こんな広い場所いらないし邪魔）のは致命的なんじゃなかろうか。 ついでに言えば、スタイリッシュだけどぱっと見何なのか全くわからんアイコンとアプリ名も完全にベンダーの自己満足。どこ行ったか分からなくて、アプリをストア経由で探しちゃったよ。今後も、必要になるたび混乱するんだと思う。 あと位置情報常時取得必須もちょっと。アプリを使用時のみ許可でも動くようにして欲しい。  とりあえず「エラーになってばかり」は旧アプリ時代経験がなく、（その後繋がったけど）動作の安定性に欠けるという事で星一つ。","1"
"144","PREP","Hi! Openly gay man here. I used the Yurekuru app over the years and LOVED IT! The mascot, the name that had the whole meaning to it, the features, layout, ease of use. Then one day it was gone.   I have way too many apps on my iPhone and while mass updating them I noticed one called PREP. I thought to myself: did I by any chance download an app to remind me to take my Truvada? Since Japanese is not my primary tongue I didn’t give it much thought.  But then came the need to check earthquake info and looking for Yurekuru specifically I realized that PREP was its new incarnation.  My first thought was: this is a real LAME choice for a name. Do the developers not realize that this has to do with HIV prevention through the regular use of Truvada mostly by gay men? Ever since I can’t take this app seriously.  To add insult to injury, the features are horrible, you are now required to create a profile in order to use it fully and their automatic, copy+paste responses to reviews in English are absolutely ridiculous.","1"
"145","PREP","3.11以降、このアプリを利用してきたユーザーは数知れずいるはずだし、助けられてもきた。余震に怯える日々、一晩中テレビを点けっぱなしにしなくても素早くアプリが通知してくれたし、ただそれだけで良かった。でも、このアプリの性質がどんどん変わってきて、ゆれ体感投稿なるものが搭載されていた頃には違和感を覚えていた。この機能、真に正しく使われているだろうか。被災地の人々を中傷するコメントがポップアップされたり、まるで意味を成さない文言が寄せられたり、明らかに嘘の体感投稿をしている者が散見されていたり。誰かが傷つく可能性がある機能なんて要らない。このアプリが生まれた原点に戻って欲しい。本当に必要なものだけあれば、それでいい。小さい子や、高齢者まで幅広い年齢層の間で救いになってきたはずのアプリだから、課金の必要性やSNSとの連携の必要性など、、考え直して欲しい。  2021/03/24 追記。前回のレビューを書いてから暫くしてアプリの名称も見た目もまるで変わってしまった。より正確・便利なものへの進化なら歓迎したが、ここ最近、度々起きている震度5以上の地震にも無反応だった。どうやら私だけではなく多数いるらしい。何も知らせてくれない防災アプリを提供し続けることは、ある意味罪ではないか。アプリを提供している方は命というものをしっかり考えて欲しい。他の皆さんのレビューに同じ回答を延々とコピペするだけの、全く熱意が感じられない作業を恥じて欲しい。3.11から10年。その間にもっと高度で便利なアプリも生まれている。もうそれらに乗り換え、こちらはアンインストールした。兎にも角にも3.11の時はありがとう。","1"

"148","PREP","EDIT : After update it seems the app is going smoothly :)  I was very surprise that the app changed without notice... but ok, I tried to open the app and created an account. There are too many loading screens ending up with an error most of the time, and when it’s not it, takes very long time to show the data, which IMO is not acceptable for an app used to get data in case of potential emergency (more than 30 second to show the earthquakes data). Gathering different emergency info in one single app was a good idea, but maybe you shouldn’t have replaced the previous app and instead creating a new one, so you could get feedback from users and correct bugs before switching people to the new one. I miss the time I could get earthquakes info rightaway... PS : I can read Japanese so the fact there is no English is not a problem at all for me.","4"

Not to mention yurekuru had an English option whereas this stupid Prep thing doesn’t. I speak Japanese but when there is an earthquake, I want to read the info quickly and not worry about misreading Kanji. Zero stars.  *add on to address the developer’s response: I can read Japanese.

"150","PREP","ゆれくる時代は大変お世話になりました。予期せぬ天災続きのここ数年、文字通りライフラインとして頼りにさせて頂きました。  最初は小規模ながら開発途上の勢いと、3.11以降の利用者急増によるサーバダウンなどで懸命な対応に追われた様子も垣間見えながらも、謙虚で素直に改善策に向けて食らいついていかれる対応に、無料アプリなのにここまで頑張ってくださって頭が下がる思いでした。  世の常ですが、大化けする商機ありと投資先から見込まれたあたりから少しずつ、本来の好評価の外堀を自ら埋めていく片鱗が窺えるにつれ、それまでの苦労が報われるという営業判断からすれば望ましいことであり、無料で恩恵に預かる身としては多くは望まないとも弁えたつもりでした。  が、今回のプレップ更新後の課金誘導メニューや個人情報登録の要請、ユーザビリティ改悪を体感し、当初信頼していた頃のシンプル且つ必要充分なサービスを期待する時期はもう終わったのだとようやく気がつくに至りました。  初代ゆれくるの開発チーム皆さんに、心から感謝の気持ちをお伝えしたいと存じます。新たなフェーズ展開となった今後のプレップについては、それがよいと選ばれるご意見もあるわけで、去るものがとやかく言う筋ではありません。幸い、とても好評価の防災アプリに期待出来そうですので、そちらを利用させて頂くつもりです。素朴なゆれくるナマズくんが懐かしいですが、今まで大変お世話になりました。","1"

"153","PREP","震度4の地震に見舞われました。 震源が近かったので地震速報が流れなかった（間に合わなくてキャンセルされた？）のは仕方がないとして、ひどかったのはその後。 情報を得ようとアプリを開いたら、バージョンが最新でないとだけ言われて、prepは地震の情報を一切教えてくれませんでした。 結局他の情報源を頼ることで事なきを得ましたが……緊急時に災害情報の表示を拒否するこのアプリって一体何の役に立つのでしょう？  今回は私がアプリ更新を数日行っていなかったのもあります。 しかし、今後偶然にも新バージョンがリリースされた直後に大災害が起きた場合、prepはユーザー全員の命を見捨てるつもりということですよね、これ。  意図せぬ不具合やサーバー負荷によるエラーは今後解決することを期待しようと、これまでの惨状には目を瞑ってきました。 しかし、災害情報を非表示にしてまでアプリ更新確認を優先させるという仕様は、被災者を殺すつもりで意図的に作らない限り発生しないでしょう。 開発メンバーが変わってしまったのか、それとも大切なものを見失った結果なのかわかりませんが、いずれにせよそんな開発思想で作られているアプリに私の命はあずけられませんので、お別れすることにしました。 ゆれくる時代から長らくお世話になりました、ありがとうございました。","1"
"154","PREP","仕事の関係で海外に行く事が多く地震の地点登録が出来ていたので万が一でも設定をしておけば通知が届くので連絡もしやすく助かっていました。 そんなに毎日見るようなアプリでもないのでアップデートも自動にしていましたが、アプリの内容が全く変わってしまっていて驚きました。 以前にあった地点登録はなくなってしまったのでしょうか？ 3地点登録出来たのは遠く離れた異国の地では大変助かっていました。 デベロッパーから地点登録機能が消えたと返信があれば解約します。 万が一の為に衛星携帯電話などを契約して連絡を取れるようにしているので、他のアプリをダウンロードして1つ1つ登録場所を変えておくしかなさそうです。 無料時代から使っていて、有料になっても家族を思えばと思っていましたが、これでは意味がなくなってしまいました。 ゆれくるはゆれくるで単体として、ゆれくるプラスでも何でも他のアプリにして出せばよかったのでは？と思います。 起動に時間がかかる上にすぐに見たい情報にアクセスしにくいという点から継続を解除する事にしました。 もう有料で我慢していた人の不満はレビューを超えています。 初心に戻ってください。 そうしたらユーザーも戻ってくるかもしれませんが時間が経過すれば他のアプリに慣れてしまって戻らないでしょう。 今までありがとうございました。","1"

"156","PREP","改善を期待して、消さずにprep入れてあります。 改善はまったく感じませんが、アプリ内にゆれくるiOS版再リリース、と告知があったので、さっそくapp storeで探しましたが、ありませんよね？ 少額とはいえお金取ってますよね？ 定型文の回答は不要ですので、告知について明確なご回答をお願いします。 ゆれくるは、いつ、再リリースされるのですか？  ━━━━━━━━━━━ 今日の地震は事前通知も来ませんでした。 ゆれくるの時はこんなことなかった！ 代替えが探せてないのでまだ仕方なく使ってますが、正直、地震予測アプリとしてはまったく機能していません。  しかも発生後にやっと通知があり、アプリを立ち上げても相変わらず不明なエラーと表示されます。 課金ずっーとしてますけど、これ商品価値ありますか？  （以上、20/10/28追記）  数年来の有料会員ですが、今回プレップになってから酷すぎます。 先ほどの地震で通知はあったものの、いさアプリを利用しようとすると、何度も「エラーです、時間が経ってから再度お試しください」というアラートがでて使い物になりません。  緊急時にそんなこと言ってられるんでしょうか？ ゆれくるユーザーは地震情報が欲しくて課金していたと思います。 不要な機能が増えて肝心の地震情報か利用できないのであれば意味がないかと思います。 月額500〜1000円でも、ちゃんと使える地震通知に特化したアプリならニーズがあると思います。 ゆれくるに戻してほしいです。  ご検討ください。","1"
"157","PREP","旧ゆれくるコールの時からお世話になっていました。東日本大震災が発生して以降、非常に重要な役割を果たしていただいたアプリの1つでした。自然災害が頻発する今の時代、より防災に特化したアプリ「PREP」のリリースすると聞いて、ゆれくるコール時代の軽快さや分かりやすさに物凄く期待していました。 しかしながら、待望のアップデートを行うと、「設定時、画面変わる度のローディングの鬱陶しさ」「画面の内容の見づらさ」「地震発生時の情報を確認しようとしたらサーバー自体が応答せず情報が見られない」「トラブル発生時の対応の遅さやトラブル発生時の報告の遅さ」など、課題が山積みのまま、リリース日を向かえてしまった感じが否めなく、非常に残念でした。 コロナ渦の開発、他の防災アプリもあり、競合するために見切り発車した気持ちは分からなくもないですが、自然災害を相手としているのでしっかりとアプリやシステムを作り上げ、満足する形になるまではゆれくるコールのままでやっていった欲しかったです。  非常に残念ですが、今のままでは期待が全く出来ないのでお別れします。ゆれくるコール時代での毎月の投資も意味が無く、他の防災アプリで優秀な物が出てきたので今後はそちらに投資させていただきます。 今まで大変お世話になりました。","1"
"158","PREP","明らかに周りが揺れていて、地震だと感じたのでアプリを開きました。  エラーが発生しました。 何度試しても開きません。 バージョンも最新です。 通信環境も確認しました。 Wi-Fi環境下と4G回線で試しましたが、他のアプリには一切問題ない。このアプリだけエラーが起きているので、このアプリ自体の問題だと思われます。  地震が起きた時にしか開かないようなアプリなのに、肝心な時にエラーで開けないってあまりにも酷い。  むしろ地震が来る前に通知してくれるようなアプリなのに、地震の前も後も開けないって需要全くないです。この地震が南海トラフだったら手遅れじゃないかと。  単純にゆれくるのままで良かった。 ゆれくるは本当に優秀だったんですが、どうやら劣化してしまったみたいです。  これはついでですが、アカウントを作らないと細かな設定ができないというのが、以前と比べても劣化にしか感じません。 アカウントの必要性が一切わかりません。課金したアカウントを管理しやすくするためですかね。 ゆれくるの様に直感的に、アプリを開いてすぐ役に立つ情報が見れなければ若者には分かっても、親の世代や祖父母の世代には緊急時の役には立ちません。むしろ気をとられ時間を無駄にしかねない。  改善というか、ゆれくるの様なアプリに戻ることを期待しておきます。","1"
"159","PREP","災害全般に対応すべくと言う志は素敵だと思います。 しかし、それは結果として旧揺れくるコールのユーザーを排除する形になってしまっていると思います。  揺れくるは名前の如く地震に特化したアプリで、細かい設定震度での通知や広域の震源地一覧を閲覧できる非常にシンプルで良い物でした。 まず、この度の大型アップデートでそのシンプルさが失われました。新規のユーザーには良いと思いますが、多くの既存ユーザーを無視した設計に感じます。  シンプルさを一番阻害しているのは天気の機能がついたことが大きいです。ゲリラ豪雨などの通知を行うアプリは既存の競合が多数存在し、それらを既にインストールしているユーザーが多いかと思います。今まで地震に関しての情報を見るアプリだったのが余計な情報を織り交ぜ操作も複雑になり、地震に関する情報が見れず本来の役割が果たせていない役立たずと化しました。なぜ別のアプリとしてラインナップしなかったのかが不思議なぐらいです。  そして今までの設定もリセットされたのか、震度0でも通知が来るようになり、設定をし直しての利用価値が無いと判断し、アンインストールしました。  旧バージョン版のものの出品を強く希望します。","1"

"68","Hjelp 113","Før oppdateringen idag kunne jeg velge stedstjenrster med valg 'Ved bruk'. Jeg vil ikke ha på stedstjenester Alltid eller Aldri.  Håper det rettes opp slik at når jeg har behov så vil steder dukke opp NÅR jeg trykker på appen.","1"
"69","Hjelp 113","Jeg vet ofte ikke hvordan jeg skulle forklart nødsentralen veien til der jeg er, når jeg ikke er hjemme. Med denne lille, raske, og enkle appen kan jeg ringe 113 (fra appen) og opplyse om både nøyaktig posisjon (koordinater) og hvor jeg er (nærmeste stedsnavn/adresse). Nå trenger jeg ikke bekymre meg lenger for hva jeg skal gjøre hvis noe skjer med min samboer eller meg når vi er på tur og jeg ikke vet helt hvor vi er. Hjelpen vil dermed kunne komme raskere frem!","5"
"70","Hjelp 113","Flott og viktig app, men etter siste oppgradering bruker den lengre tid på å starte opp, og her jeg sitter nå er det ikke samsvar mellom adressetekstfeltet og kartet. (Adressetekstfeltet er feil). Er det mulig å gå tilbake til forrige versjon?","2"
"71","Hjelp 113","Veldig fornøyd med appen, har heldigvis ikke trekt å bruke den, men liker ideen bak den.  Appen holder opp til forventningene!  Hvis jeg skal gi et lite trekk. Noen ganger ser du bare halve addressen, der hvor det står Nærmeste addresse. Det er noe som kunne vært fiksa på, men kordinatene er jo mye bedre og mer nøyaktig!","5"
"72","Hjelp 113","Tittelen sier det meste","5"
"73","Hjelp 113","Denne bør alle ha. Burde den også hatt en funksjon som viser grunnleggende hjerte- lungeredning?","5"
"74","Hjelp 113","Som en yrkes sjåfør så vet jeg aldri hva som kan oppstå i trafikken, derfor har jeg valgt å laste ned denne appen pga at det vil gjøre det lettere for meg og andre når en nødsituasjon oppstår. Denne appen vil også hjelp 113 med å finne din posisjon, som igjen gjør at du/andre vil kunne få hjelp så fort som mulig. Hvert sekund teller.","5"
"75","Hjelp 113","Anbefales på det sterkeste","5"

"77","Hjelp 113","Jeg tillot ikke appen tilgang til adresseboka mi, den virker likevel. (Hvis ikke ville, i alle fall jeg, avinstallert den!)","2"
"78","Hjelp 113","Endelig en nyttig funksjon som gjør at du samtidig som du ringer alarmsentral kan fortelle hvor du er:-) Det er posisjonen som er viktig og riktig. Adressen som fremkommer er omtrentlig og ikke så viktig.","5"
"79","Hjelp 113","Ser ikke problemet med at appen er for lett å komme borti. For å virkelig ringe må man først trykke på appen, så trykke ring 1-1-3, så svare på om man virkelig vil ringe. Altså 3 trykk før man ringer 113.   På et førstehjelpkurs for ett år siden fikk vi anbefalt appen. Der ble det sagt at når man ringte via appen, fikk sentralen automatisk opp posisjon på sin skjerm stemmer ikke dette, siden det står at man kan gi de koordinatene fra appen?  Har dessverre måttet bruke denne appen selv, men da var den til gjengjeld god å ha. Ble ikke spurt etter posisjon, men oppga en ca adresse, så da trodde jeg de så posisjonen min siden jeg ringte via appen.","5"

"81","Hjelp 113","Kjempefin app. Har ikke hatt noe problem med gps og finner min posisjon med stor nøyaktighet (ikke prøvd på fjellet enda). Noe som plager meg er at det er alt for lett å komme borti 113 knappen.","4"
"82","Hjelp 113","Bra app, men adressen vår er feil.... Bør oppdateres med nye gatekart. Det er bare ca 3-4 år siden gaten endret navn...","3"
"83","Hjelp 113","Feil adresse da kartet er utdatert og vi bor i nytt (4 år gammelt) boligfelt.  Luftambulansen går vel gjerne etter koordinatene, så hadde vel kanskje funnet meg likevel.. Hvis de er rett da :-)","2"
"84","Hjelp 113","Dette er en livreddende app som kan hjelpe alle. En kjempe app som viser hvor du er hvis du trenger hjelp. En takk til norsk luftambulanse  BESTE APP","5"
"85","Hjelp 113","Klarer ikke oppgi riktig hjemmeadresse, den oppgir både feil gatenavn og nummer.","1"
"86","Hjelp 113","Helt sikkert en fin app, men jeg savner en begrunnelse for at man skal gi tilgang til adressebok. Hvorfor det? En adressebok er privat og jeg skjønner ikke behovet for å gi slik tilgang. Ser andre har spurt om det samme. Utvikler bør gi et svar.","3"
"87","Hjelp 113","I en slik alvorlig situasjon er kartet helt på tur! Det må fikses om det skal være noen hensikt med denne appen!","1"
"88","Hjelp 113","Burde vært en mulighet for en kode eller noe slik at barn ikke trykker seg inn  og ringer 113 Ellers topp","4"
"89","Hjelp 113","1) Bruker ofte lang tid til å hente posisjon 2) Ofte unøyaktig posisjon (Men bruker jeg fks TomTom appen så finner den meg med engang) GPS fungerer altså helt fint 3) Litt klønete grensesnitt. Veldig lett å trykke 113 ved en feil (ingen barnesikring). Grafikk er utdatert  Liker idéen veldig godt, men dette kan gjøres bedre.","2"
"90","Hjelp 113","Jeg får oppgitt at den har en nøyaktighet på 5008 meter på hytta!  Ved en sjekk på kartreferansen viser den at vi er på sjøen på tross av at vi sitter trygt på land.   Over 5 km feil (i luftlinje) er en skummel feil, og farlig å bruke om det er hastverk!","1"
"91","Hjelp 113","Det er mulig at den er grei å ha når du er på tur i skog og mark, MEN DEN KLARER IKKE Å OPPGI RIKTIG HJEMMEADRESSE SAMTIDIG SOM DEN SKRYTER AV Å HA EN NØYAKTIGHET PÅ 30 METER!!!!!","1"
"92","Hjelp 113","Nydelig","5"

"95","Hjelp 113","17 kroner for en app du ikke kommer til å bruke mer enn kanskje en gang er i dette tilfellet helt supert! Dette kan fir enkelte være forskjellen mellom liv og død! Og skulle du glemme å bruke appen i farta, kan den jo fremdeles brukes under en vanlig samtale. :)","5"
"96","Hjelp 113","Havnet i det tilfelle at jeg fikk bruk for den. Når jeg først var i samband med amk så er appen lukket og man er som regel ganske stressa når man ringe de. Det var mye lettere å muntlig forklare ca hvor man var enn å begynne å knote på tlf når man hadde langt viktigere ting å gjøre. Hadde de kunne gjort dette mer tilpasset nødstilfeller ville jeg ha brukt den igjen. Føler kun jeg sitter igjen med 17 kr til en god sak og en snarvei til 113 på tlf.","1"
"97","Hjelp 113","Denne virket bra før, men etter overgang til iOS4 virker den ikke mer. Den finner ikke posisjonen din lenger. Kjempesynd, for tanken bak app'n er kjempebra.","2"

"101","Hjelp 113","Svakheten med denne appen, er at du forhåpentligvis aldri får brukt den. Med andre ord kommer appen til å gå i glemmeboka, og den dagen ulykka er ute vil du være så stressa at du kommer til å slå 113 manuelt. Så egentlig er appen ubrukelig.","4"

"105","Hjelp 113","Har vært en av de første på et ulykkessted der det var små barn innvolvert.

"1","myResponder","The objective of the app is noble and well met. Just slight suggestion on the UI/UX -   1) For iOS app there is a feature on adding 3 addresses for notifications. This feature could be better complement and make smarter by having geolocation detection, where if a case happens 10-20km away, the user wouldnt be notified. Or an additional button beside “Accept” and “Decline”. It can sometime feel ethically and morally stress to decline a call, not because the users don’t want to help but is unable to because of distance and yet being notified.   2) On Submission of feedback, for email placeholder it says “Optional” yet when submitting an empty submission it says missing value. Please make this consistent.","4"
"2","myResponder","Firstly, small issue, but can be implemented in future updates: not optimised for iPhone X. Crashes upon launch but resolved when reinstalled.  Secondly, would be great if responders are notified by the ETA for a preferred mode of transport (walking, bicycle, car/bike) rather than radius as a neighboring estate can be beyond the radius but a responder from my estate can definitely get there ahead of the EMS (more so on bicycle or car/bike).","4"
"3","myResponder","There is an alert, but can’t open the app. It hangs at the first screen with “scdf” wording and then the app closed by itself after awhile.","4"
"4","myResponder","9 out of 10 times the app simply crashes & exits after displaying message asking for permission to turn on location service. When it does not crash, it just hangs and tapping on anything has no effect. Considering SCDF asked people to call via this app for better location tracking, this is a joke!","1"
"5","myResponder","Received a notification of a case but unable to open the app past Getting updates page. The app is already the latest version. The app also tends to keep the case page on the last missed case and not update to the newest case. Unable to help people in need even if I want to!","2"
"6","myResponder","Valuable app to alert community first responders (CFR), to render a helping hand and support to save a life, extinguish a fire before arrival of SCDF resources. Key enabler to build and work towards a nation of lifesavers.","5"
"7","myResponder","Notified me of cardiac arrest cases nearby. Has helped me to contribute as part of my social responsibility.","4"
"8","myResponder","Great and simple app that helps the community! Save a life simply by having this app on your phone!","5"
"9","myResponder","The biggest benefit of this app is sending one’s location while dialing 995. A definite lifesaver for those hard-to-describe locations such as PCNs, landed housing estates, etc.","5"
"10","myResponder","Excellent app that alert the public of any heart attack cases and small fires happening nearby. 👍👍","5"
"11","myResponder","Very valuable in getting quick response to any incident.","5"
"12","myResponder","App gives wrong location and updates lapse.  But worse, when you try to inform the service/control centre side, you get very discouraged because instead of trying to remedy the problem, you get the blame. Shocks to the core, not even AED can revive you. I gave up.","1"
"13","myResponder","The latest app has not been useful at all! Crashes most of the time and does not provide any real situation or notification. An app that occupy space. I get call ups from SGSecure for cardiac arrest - so what is this app for?","1"
"14","myResponder","Can’t close the input keyboard after the name and email addresses are filled in, which results in unable to proceed because the “continue” button is hidden under the input keyboard. Maybe there should be a “done” button appear in the input keyboard to close the keyboard?","1"
"15","myResponder","Useful app to know where the nearest public AEDs are to save lives of possible cardiac arrest victims.","5"
"16","myResponder","I’m using an iPhone XR on IOS 13.2, and have not been able to use the app. There is also no service that serves to help users fix their issues, so am a little disappointed.","2"
"17","myResponder","I received a notification for the first time and the app crashed. The app kept staying on the loading screen and kicked me out.","2"
"18","myResponder","How do we respond to cases when the app does not work? I received the message about a case through SMS but can’t open the app. Please improve the app expeditiously.","1"
"19","myResponder","This app is a real necessity for the city. However it’s not been optimised for my Iphone XR and from other reviews i think it’s for any iphone above X that are facing these bugs that cause us to crash or not be able to connect properly","1"
"20","myResponder","App keeps closing itself. Can’t even update profile. Imagine if it there is a life and death emergency and I am the nearest one available to help but the app keeps crashing. Please update.","1"

"39","myResponder","Handsome ambassador i like","5"
"40","myResponder","Good","5"
"41","myResponder","It's a great idea for a life saving app like this. But being a life saving app, it would be much useful if the AED map loading would have been faster. Map didn't load after 5 minutes of waiting. Maybe should consider using something more common like, Google Map? Thanks","3"
"42","myResponder","Very good!!!!","1"
"43","myResponder","Although I could rch there a bit earlier , the app could have some some for improvement Hoping for new update The location and the area should be stated from the start since I am a new user and the show Id button made me confuse at first, then to realise it stated the floor of the shopping center where the collapsed victim is","4"

"53","myResponder","Download now hahaa From J L YAP","5"
"1","Namola","As a first I have to say, if you’re reading this download the app! It can change the outcome of a really bad situation.  My only complaint is that this app keeps on sending me notifications about people’s stories or Covid-19 statistics. While it’s a nice sentiment, please give us the option to stop receiving these. It’s driving me to the point where I want to put notifications off entirely, which defeats the point of the app if one of my contacts is in danger. Please, stop with the useless notifications.","4"
"2","Namola","Thank you so much to every single person who plays a role in this app!   I have used Namola 3 times now, once for a break in at our complex, second time was for a pedestrian who was knocked over by a car which we witnessed and tonight when my female friend felt unsafe after drunk neighbors harassed her while she was alone at home. Every time we got a call back with 3 seconds and all the call operators calmly helped us and made sure we were taken care of, safe or did everything in their power to help.   This app should be on every South African’s phone.","5"
"3","Namola","Great app and very fast call back📞. I’ll ask to add a cancel button when you “Request assistance” because the only way out is to say other and then they call you (very fast). Adding a panic button (using your volume or lock button) to tap multiple time so that you don’t have to open your app. When you are in an emergency you don’t want to struggle to find the app. And lastly Apple Watch app will be great.","4"
"4","Namola","Such an easy app to use. Response is quick and efficient. Have used this app to call an ambulance at the scene of an accident, the fire brigade for a house fire and our local security company when we had an intruder. Can’t recommend it enough!! When you’re panicked, you can’t always remember which number to call, so with the press of a button, they call you within seconds and then do the calling of the correct department.","5"
"5","Namola","My mom has the app so I downloaded it just in case but now I see a flaw. What happens if you forgot to make an account and you have an emergency? Well I ain’t taking no time to make an account in an emergency I would like a emergency button you tap when you don’t have an account. Just add a simple button that instantly gets help to you.","4"
"6","Namola","Have had my Namola panic button and this app for a while. The app is terrible with it not reading location or reporting location correctly and then is when the app doesn’t constantly force quit on me. The panic button is chronically off-line and have returned it once already to be replaced. For the cost of the panic tracker and the monthly subscription, it’s really not worth all this hassle. No point in having a panic tracker that logs me at Sandton Gautrain station when I’m standing at Sandton Square","2"
"7","Namola","Namola has become my go-to safety app, and it has truly won my heart. Its location sharing feature is a game-changer, offering me peace of mind and allowing me to always know where my family is! Especially with the additional Safety Alerts!   If safety and peace of mind are your priorities, Namola is the app you need!","5"
"8","Namola","Namola's Smart Alerts feature has truly been a game-changer for me! It's a huge relief to receive notifications when my wife is safely home or has left work, especially during those moments when I can't reach her.   This app is awesome!","5"
"9","Namola","When trying to access “Manage your plan” after subscribing. The app crashes, i did reinstall and everything is up to date. I also did restRt my iPhone.","4"
"10","Namola","I don’t know how everyone in SA doesn’t already have Namola on their phones for back-up. It gives me the peace of mind of knowing what to do in the event of an unfortunate situation. Also, the location-tracking is incredible!","5"
"11","Namola","I have used this app on two occasions - one robbery and one medical emergency  On both occasions Namola was on the ball and got me help without me having to have to make several phone calls This is a must have app !!","5"
"12","Namola","Really sad that the Watch app and complication was removed in v8.4.0 and was not mentioned in the change log. The Watch app kept Namola SOS two quick presses away on your wrist. I love the concept of Namola but the removal of the Watch functionality has made its use more difficult for me.","3"
"13","Namola","Did a test and got a call within a few seconds.  As a suggestion you could introduce a “I’m Safe” password in the case of a high jacking or home invasion where the perpetrator answers my phone","5"
"14","Namola","The app was super helpful it my first time using the app  We just had a group of criminal jump in our yard and the response from Namola was instant thank you for bringing back a sense of peace and calm when I was at the verge of panicking","5"
"15","Namola","Highly recommend all South Africans to install this app. Namola has always responded to an emergency/crisis or general alert to offer assistance.  Will the Apple Watch functionality return?","5"
"16","Namola","The app works well, support is fast and friendly and the idea behind the app along with implementation is great!  Far better than the ‘community’ apps like Buzzed","5"
"17","Namola","Requested assistance 5 in the morning and got a call in under 10 seconds.   My whole family will now download this app.","5"
"18","Namola","Great App! Could a Share Button be added to the app, to make it easier to share with Family and Friends.","5"
"19","Namola","Accidentally tested the app and got a call in under 30 seconds! Really appreciate what you have developed, and the service you provide.","5"
"20","Namola","The response when you have an emergency is very fast.   My problem is that the app is not updating as your contacts move around.  Even my own movements are not recorded correctly.  That is a bit disappointing.","3"
"21","Namola","My app does not show my home location-my address it says city of Johannesburg metropolitan  Please amend","4"
"22","Namola","The time following a traumatic injury when prompt medical treatment could mean the difference between life and death... #thegoldenhour","5"
"23","Namola","This is how we will feel safe again. You guys have listened to the public and we appreciate it.","5"
"24","Namola","Great idea.    Is it possible to get Apple Watch capability?  Also Siri can take you to app Namola.  Is it possible to request assistance with voice?","5"
"25","Namola","Absolutely a wonderful app . They call within 10 sec . I highly recommended","5"
"26","Namola","Easy to navigate and easy to use.  The best app I’ve downloaded adding real value to my smart phone.","5"
"27","Namola","This is a great idea, however it should work over WiFi & internet as we have no cell phone reception on our farm. I’m sure not many farmers have good reception on their properties.","3"
"28","Namola","THANKS!, share button would be great though","5"
"29","Namola","I don’t like the new version of the app cause I can’t find the option to check the device battery strength","3"
"30","Namola","Great app. An Apple Watch app would be a great addition as it’s right on the wrist and with complication support it’s literally a tap away","5"
"31","Namola","Amazing! Did a test and got a call not even 10 seconds later, I am extremely impressed.","5"
"32","Namola","The response time and caring service is beyond brilliant!  They are literally life savers!","5"
"33","Namola","I tested the emergency button and someone called me in 5 seconds to hear if I am ok or need assistance.","5"
"34","Namola","Namola is amazing! I have just tested the App, and the response time was unbelievable!","5"
"35","Namola","The app does not open since I have updated","2"
"36","Namola","Perfect for the current political landscape! Exactly what SA needs to replace the inept emergency services response.","5"

"4","Emergency Ready App","This app is a great replacement for those phone emergency alerts. Some great things:  1. Can specify areas of interest.  So you can get emergency alerts related only to your neighborhood, or other location, or both, etc. Good when family or workplace are spread out.   2. Respects phone mode settings So if phone is silent or vibrate, these alerts come silently or by vibration. No more blaring loud sounds in public   3. Better translations  Previously the foreign language translations of Korean original messages was bad and sometimes incomprehensible. Now they use Google auto translation and they’re much more clear.   4. Alert history If you accidentally swipe away an alert, there’s a list of previous alerts to consult. That list is all alerts nationwide which sometimes makes it difficult to find yours but still it’s a good resource.   Overall the app provides a good features set. I’m glad it is available and multilingual. Thank you.","5"
"5","Emergency Ready App","Useful app, I can follow the number of cases concerning the COVID-19, but sometimes the translation doesn’t mean anything at all. I am not an English native so it’s even more difficult to understand when it’s not clear at all (in a Coronavirus case, talking about earthquake? Does it mean a cluster?). I hope the new versions will have a better translation.","2"

Att kunna dela sin position genom registreringen när man ringer 112 (utan att ringa via appen) bör vara en självklarhet, men finns ej i nuläget. Skulle underlätta både för användare och personal på SOS.  Att lägga till en Meddelande funktion, för dem som behöver höra av sig till 112 i tysthet eller saknar talförmåga.  Flerspråkigt stöd och valbart i inställningar.  Kunna ta bort meddelanden man redan läst och ej vill se.  Kunna se historik i händelser i området man sökt på/befinner sig i, 24h bakåt i tiden.

Det står ALDRIG några aktuella händelser, fast att det händer saker hela tiden.   Just i detta nu är det pågående brand som finns med i andra appen (för arbetande inom SOS), men i denna står som vanligt ”inga aktuella händelser”.  Så vad exakt ska man ha appen till?","1"

"17","SOS Alarm","Min app spårade mig 71 gånger i bakgrunden på 3 dygn. Varför? Finns ingen anledning varför 112 appen ska veta vart jag är när den inte används.

Men det kunde jag fetglömma. SOS fick inga koordinater och det tog minst 30 minuter innan dom ens kunde lista ut vart jag var, sen dröjde det ytterligare ca 40min innan första räddningsfordonet var på plats. Som tur var vart jag bara lindrigt skadad. Jag vågar inte ens tänka tanken vad som hade hänt om jag hade haft allvarligare skador. Skrämmande dålig app och skrämmande hur dom lovar att SOS ska få mina koordinater när dom inte får det.","1"

"21","SOS Alarm","Det skulle vara bra om man i appen kunde ställa in viktiga platser. Till exempel om man arbetar på annan ort än där man bor skulle det vara bra om man kunde få notiser om det händer något där man bor, brand t.ex. Detta är speciellt viktigt om man har djur eller så i bostaden.","4"
"22","SOS Alarm","Tanken är fantastisk. Små missar här och där, som t.ex. larm-signalen fungerar ej. Några funktioner så som viktig hälso information som SOS operatören bör veta, borde synas eller skickas till SOS vid samtal för underlätta arbetet för ambulans personalen. Appen blir bara bättre och bättre. Fortsätt med det. Utmärkt!!!","5"
"23","SOS Alarm","Tycker över lag det är en bra idé. Men om de ska vara en SOS app som ska vara behjälplig behövs de lite mer uppdateringar angående både stora och små händelser vare sig det är en trafik olycka eller ett ”hål” vid en vältrafikerad väg behöver ni bli duktigare på att uppdatera händelser. Skulle gärna önska att ha möjligheten att kolla händelser längre bort från där jag är exempelvis om min sambo eller partner jobbar en bit ifrån pchbinre har möjligheten att kolla upp vad som händer.","3"

Som deltidsbrandman får jag alla larm i mitt närområde på sms så kan lätt jämföra med appen. 9/10 gånger aviserar appen ingenting.

"40","SOS Alarm","Jag har aktiverat platstjänster för enheten i ”inställningar”-”integritet och säkerhet”, men appen dyker inte upp i den lista som hittas vid ”inställningar”-”integritet och säkerhet”-”platstjänster” där man får ge ytterligare instruktion om när platsen ska ges.   Exempelvis så finns appen ”alltid öppet” i den listan. För den appen kan jag välja att definiera ”aldrig”, ”fråga nästa gång när jag delar” ”när appen används” eller ”alltid”. SOS alarm finns inte i samma lista.  Jag har startat om enheten men det avhjälper inte problemet.  Jag får ett felmeddelande i SOS alarm-appen om att ”appen fungerar bara korrekt om den har åtkomst till plats”. Vid den alerten kan jag trycka på ”ändra” och då länkas jag vidare till appens inställningar, som man finner under ”inställningar”-”SOS alarm”, men även där finns inga inställningsmöjligheter som avser plats. Där finns enbart ”Siri och sökning” ”notiser” ”appaktiviteter i bakgrunden” och ”mobildata”  Jag har kontrollerat om andra appars platstjänster fungerar och det gör de. Jag har kontrollerat detta genom att bland annat starta appen Badoo med platstjänster aktiverat och då får jag upp en alert där jag får frågan om jag vill dela ungefärlig plats eller exakt plats och detta i samband med en karta som även visar min exakta plats.  vid ”inställningar”-”integritet och säkerhet”-”platstjänster”-”dela min platsinfo” får jag upp en sys modal alert som anger ”Dela min platsinfo ej tillgängligt. Kan inte ansluta till servern. Försök igen senare”. Jag har då sen scrollat ner till ”systemtjänster” i den övre menynivån ”platstjänster” och där under ”systemtjänster” ser jag att  ”dela min platsinfo” är aktiverad. De övriga aktiverade platstjänsterna för systemtjänster är ”enhetehantering” ”hitta min IPhone” ”mobilnätssökning” ”nätverk och trådlöst” ”nödsamtal och SOS”. Övriga 12 systemtjänsters platstjänster är inte aktiverade. Vill exempelvis inte ha platsbaserade notiser och förslag, försäljaridentifiering, iPhone analys och annat integritetskränkande. Dessa avaktiverade får dock ingen utfall avseende att finns min plats vid användning av kartor såsom Eniro, SL, Maps.Me, Kartor och Sverigetaxi.  Jag har obegränsad data. Jag har internetanslutning.  Telefonen är försatt i Lockdown mode. Använder den inställningen för att det bland annat avaktiverar JIT kompilering för Javascript. Buggar i JIT utnyttjas av 45 % av all Malware som angriper enheter via en webbläsare. Jag har enbart upplevt strul med en app tidigare på grund av lock down mode och det är appen Line. Då skickas inte det sms som man behöver för att verifiera numret. Det smset fick jag däremot vid registrering i SOS Alarm. Även Instagrams automatiska inloggning genom att den känner igen enheten efter en ominstallation av appen, fungerar ej, så att man måste ange lösenordet den första gången man använder den appen. I övrigt så upplever jag inga problem förutom att vissa fonter i webbläsare som avser ikoner, blir fyrkanter, men det indikerar enbart att webbutvecklaren är bedrövlig i det avseendet att de behöver frameworks och Google fonter osv så att de inte har god koll på vad de egentligen har under huven.  Under ”inställningar”-”integritet och säkerhet”-analys och förbättringar” är alla inställningar avaktiverade.  Jag befinner mig i Sverige.  ISP Tele2.  Jag är inte ansluten till en Acess Point dvs router + switch.  Jag är inte ansluten till en VPN. VPN är under inställningar  ”ej ansluten” och programmet som avser VPN är helt avstängt och inte startat efter reboot.  Jag har inte testat om SOS alarm fungerar om man avaktiverar Lockdown mode eftersom att då får jag väl Pegasus genast. En enhet som befinner sig i lockdown mode är nog extra intressant så nu vågar jag inte stänga av den trots att jag är en ointressant person.  Jag ger en stjärna eftersom att det inte finns någon information om att appen inte fungerar i ”Lockdown mode”  En stor tistel till Sverige SOS-tjänst som inte har implementerat gps-detektering vid vanliga telefonsamtal som övriga länder, så att man istället behöver en app. Bedrövligt att Sverige har halka så långt efter i nästan varje teknologisk aspekt och även på områden som avser vår välfärd.","1"
"41","SOS Alarm","Med tanke på att appen nu funnits ett tag borde det finnas mer information i appen, som tex info om AKUT test , HLR.  Och att det skulle vara möjligt att lägga appen som widget för snabbare åtkomst om ni nu vill att man ska använda den för att underlätta för er då man ringer","4"

Har skickat in felanmälan via appen om detta men fick svaret att avslutade händelser inte syns på startsidan.  Men detta är ju _aktuella_ händelser som inte syns på startsidan.

Kanske en funktion där jag kan välja själv hur stort område jag vill få information om? Annars är appen en bra idé med koordinater och så.","3"

"90","SOS Alarm","Har haft appen ett bra tag nu men får inga som helst notiser.

"102","SOS Alarm","Appen är jättebra och tydlig. Däremot brister den med att varna för faror i närheten. Byggnaden bredvid mitt hus stod övertänt men fick inte ett meddelande i appen. Skulle vilja se detta i framtiden ifall man inte vet att det brinner nära.","4"
"103","SOS Alarm","Får inga varningar alls- alla notiser är påslagna, kan stå bredvid en utryckning - ändå fråntagen inga notiser . Jag får inga notiser alls - stod bredvid en  brand häromdagen - andra i byn fick notis men inte jag …","1"

"116","SOS Alarm","Version 1.0.19 Har önskat detta sedan flera versioner men fortfarande i Version 1.0.19 så SAKNAS möjligheten, sänker betyget! Jag missar alla larm/notiser eftersom appen är för DISKRET! Jag vill kunna välja en audiosignal själv så att jag märker när appen varnar/ larmar, och gärna olika för varning kontra info.","1"
"117","SOS Alarm","Bra app om den skulle skicka ut meddelande när aktuella olyckor sker..tidningarna är till och med snabbare på informera","2"

"121","SOS Alarm","Bra app och bra tanke med den, tar dock 20% av min batteriförbrukning dagligen vilket jag inte ”har råd med”.","3"
"122","SOS Alarm","Upptäckte att telefonens batteri plötsligt dränerades mycket snabbare än vanligt och fann att det var denna app. Det beror INTE på senaste iOS, då min telefon inte ens stödjer detta. Det går givetvis inte att behålla appen med denna potentiellt farliga brist. Avinstallerad!","2"
"123","SOS Alarm","Bra app som tyvärr drar alldeles för mycket batteri i bakgrunden.","2"
"124","SOS Alarm","Appens primära funktion måste väl vara att man känna sig säker på att bli hittad vid en olycka i t.ex svampskogen, eller.. Hur fungerar det när appen har tömt batteriet? - Inte så bra!! Åtgärda på stört!!!","1"

"127","SOS Alarm","Drog AS mycket batteri från telefonen. Och synd att man inte kan skicka mess till SOS!  Tänker de ggr något händer och man inte kan ringa!!","2"
"128","SOS Alarm","Bra och viktig app, men som andra användare skrivit så slukar den batteri! Under ett dygn står den för 35% av batterianvändningen! Och jämför detta med att jag har musikappar igång i minst 8 timmar per dag som står för ca 20% av batterianvändningen.","2"
"129","SOS Alarm","Senaste versionen (1.0.15) verkar dränera batteriet väldigt snabbt.   Plötsligt så började min telefon laddade ur väldigt snabbt. Kollade då telefonens strömförbrukning och upptäckte att appen stod för en väldigt hög andel. Har inte upplevt det problemet med de tidigare versionerna, trots konstant påslagen platsinformation.  Annars är appen ok.","2"
"130","SOS Alarm","Hej.  Jag kan inte starta appen, den kraschar direkt. Bör man uppdatera OS eller appen?","3"
"131","SOS Alarm","Sedan senaste uppdateringen äter appen batteri i massor! Innan har jag varit nöjd.","1"
"132","SOS Alarm","Bra idé men appen är helt oanvändbar då den drar 100% CPU konstant.  Man undrar hur de tänkt man ska kunna ringa 112 med en död telefon.","1"
"133","SOS Alarm","Dränerar batteriet!  Jättebra app men en super NACKDEL är att den dränerar batteriet på telefonen då den behöver ha på platstjänst för att fylla funktionen med appen.","2"
"134","SOS Alarm","Börjat att dra sjuk mycket batteri!","2"
"135","SOS Alarm","Allvarligt talat, jag har flera appar som ligger och jobbar i bakgrunden utan att använda dem. Denna app står för 23% av min telefons batteriförbrukning trots att jag har varit inne i appen en handfull gånger sedan den kom ut.","1"

"137","SOS Alarm","Det som beskrivs som versionshistorik är amatörmässigt, skärpning. Nu vill jag se i historiken att batteriproblemet är löst.","1"
"138","SOS Alarm","Telefonen fungerar inte längre utan batteriet töms på nolltid. När jag tog bort appen fungerar min lur igen. Annars var det en bra app","2"
"139","SOS Alarm","Rubriken säger allt! Måste vara bättre att kunna ringa efter hjälp på vanligt sätt än att få slut på batteri på grund av 112-appen","1"
"140","SOS Alarm","Kör slut på batteriet. Fick avinstallera. Jag har inte installerat iOS14, så det har inte med det att göra, som app-utvecklaren hävdar.","1"
"141","SOS Alarm","Gillar appen men något verkar vara fel med senaste versionen (och ev versionen innan dess). Senaste veckan eller två har min mobil fått slut på batteri mycket snabbt. Idag kollade jag vilka appar som drar mest och 112 hade ätit 33% av mitt batteri på åtta timmar, bara av att köra i bakgrundsläge (med access till location data).","4"
"142","SOS Alarm","Den här appen gjorde just vad som absolut inte får göras i ett potentiellt nödläge. Den körde batteriet i botten! Telefonen var lika död som någon som behövt nödhjälp hade varit. Oacceptabel bugg! Finns det minsta chans att du kan få behov av att kontakta 112 lita på hederliga gamla knappsatsen och avinstallera detta!","1"
"143","SOS Alarm","Efter senaste uppdateringen så slukar appen batteri. Något har blivit fel i uppdateringen. Så här har det inte varit förut. Eftersom det går åt så extremt mycket batteri så jag blev tvungen att ta bort appen. Ni har skrivit samma standardsvar till alla kommentarer, men eftersom jag inte uppdaterat till iOS 14, och appen ändå slukar batterier så borde väl problemet ligga i appen och inte i iOS?","1"
"144","SOS Alarm","Bra app men den drar mycket ström. Enligt batteri-statusen i telefonen så använder appen ca 35% av batteriet under 24 timmar.","4"
"145","SOS Alarm","Som andra redan skrivit: appen har börjat dra väldigt mycket batteri, det var inget problem tidigare. Raderar appen tills vidare.","1"
"146","SOS Alarm","Får nästan aldrig någon notis om olyckor längre . Fick visserligen en idag men få fick inte min syster någon , olyckan var ganska mitt emellan våra hem","1"
"147","SOS Alarm","Denna app laddar ur batteriet på min iPhone. Hur smart är det för en app som skall fungera i nödsituationer?","1"
"148","SOS Alarm","Drar väldigt mycket batteri. 30% av dagens åtgång är enbart sos appen. Fixa!!","3"
"149","SOS Alarm","Drar ur batteriet. Bättre att ha ström kvar i batteriet om något skulle hända, än att ha en app på en död mobil.","2"
"150","SOS Alarm","Äntligen kommit på varför jag vaknat flera dagar med en nästan urladdad telefon. Prioriterar att kunna ringa så nu är platstjänster avstängt och nästa steg blir väl att avinstallera appen om ingen uppdatering av appen kommer snart som rättar till detta problem.","1"
"151","SOS Alarm","I de senaste versionerna av appen har den börjat att dra väldigt mycket batteri pga att platsinformation alltid är igång i bakgrunden. Så har det inte varit tidigare. Jag har satt den till att endast använda positionering när appen är igång men då förlorar den nästan hela sin funktion. Snälla fixa detta.","2"
"152","SOS Alarm","Appen drar mkt batteritid när det ligger med ständig uppdatering.","2"
"153","SOS Alarm","Appen har börjat använda väldigt mycket batteri i bakgrunden under senaste veckan (upp emot 15 %). Vad har hänt? Innan har det använts ungefär 1 %.","2"
"154","SOS Alarm","Som många andra har jag numera problem att appen använder för mycket batteri. Jag har därför avinstallerat tillsvidare.","2"
"155","SOS Alarm","Helt plötsligt har appen börjat dra mycket ström. Har platstjänster i ”alltid” och det har aldrig varit problem förut. Men nu har något ändrats. Har två telefoner och båda har samma problem.  SOS Ab, undersök.","2"
"156","SOS Alarm","Väldigt bra app, problemet är bara att den ligger på konstant då den alltid ska ha ens platstjänst. Vilket resulterar i att batteriet kan laddas ur 50% över en natt.","2"
"157","SOS Alarm","Får nästan aldrig nån info om händelser.  Senast är i mars..","1"
"158","SOS Alarm","Att ha 112-appen installerad är en säkerhetsrisk.  Vid flera tillfällen den senaste tiden har jag överraskats av att telefonen stängt av sig på grund av urladdat batteri. Igår avistallerade jag 112, under hela dagen idag har batterikapaciteten sjunkit till 96%. Det var alltså inte fel på mitt batteri. Förbaskat uselt av en app som är avsedd att vara till hjälp i en nödsituation.","1"
"159","SOS Alarm","Sen en tid tillbaka så slukar appen batteri på iOS så den åkte tyvärr ut nu 😟","1"
"160","SOS Alarm","Jättebra app har det varit, tills nu! Senaste versionen fullkomligheten slaktar batteritiden. Senaste dygnen sedan den här versionen kom, så får jag ladda väldigt ofta och SOS äter mellan 43-45% av batterikapaciteten i bakgrunden! (Alltså med appen avstängd) Ni har gjort en hotfix säger ni. Skynda er göra en till med fokus på något annat tack.","1"
"161","SOS Alarm","Slukar hysteriska mängder batteri på sistone. I övrigt en bra app om man rättar till detta omgående för just nu vågar jag inte ha igång den i bakgrunden.","4"
"162","SOS Alarm","Konceptet är bra och appen som sådan fungerar, men även om man aldrig öppnar appen drar den fruktansvärt mycket batteri. Appen Batteri rapporterar att denna app förbrukar mellan 30-40 procent av min dagliga totalförbrukning. Fullständigt oacceptabelt.","1"
"163","SOS Alarm","Mycket bra app!","5"
"164","SOS Alarm","Appen har efter senaste uppdateringen börjat sluka batteri. Har tömt batteriet helt 2 dagar i rad","1"
"165","SOS Alarm","Om man larmar med iPhones inbyggda funktion skickas förutom positionen även medicinskt id. Så varför använda denna app? Och blev irriterad av att batteriet snabbt blivit urladdat efter senaste uppdateringen.","2"
"166","SOS Alarm","Efter senaste uppdatering så slukar appen batteri, så tack å hej","1"
"167","SOS Alarm","Efter senaste uppdateringen har den blivit en batterislukare om bakgrundsuppdatering tillåts.","3"
"168","SOS Alarm","De senaste dagarna har mitt batteri laddats ur rekordsnabbt, t.o.m. i flygplansläge under natten. Därför har jag varit tvungen att stänga av platstjänster när appen inte används. (Vad hjälper platstjänster när telefonen ändå är död?) Så här var det inte innan senaste uppdateringen. Gör om, gör rätt!","1"
"169","SOS Alarm","I morse hade jag 3% kvar i batteriet, som var fulladdat igår. En koll i statistiken visade att denna app legat och dragit konstant i bakgrunden under natten, till nästan 0%.","1"
"170","SOS Alarm","På senare tid har jag inte klarar en normal dag på full laddning, kollade batterihälsan som var bra (97%) sen listan med storförbrukare och denna app är med stor marginal den största förbrukaren!!! 33% pga bakgrundsplats och tvåan använder 16%. Crazy!! Fixa detta snälla!","2"
"171","SOS Alarm","Bra app, men enligt min iPhones (SE 2) batteriförbruknings sida är det den app som drar i särklass mest kräm i bakgrundsläge.","3"

"174","SOS Alarm","Jag tänker varken tillåta gps-positionering eller lämna ut mitt telefonnummer, det är min privata integritetspolicy.

"181","SOS Alarm","Fungerar bra. Men skulle vara kanon om ni fick med ex. Eldningsförbud i mitt område.","4"
"182","SOS Alarm","Positionen är inte att lita på. Den visar grannars hus och hittar inte riktigt rätt position. Ska appen fylla sitt syfte måste denna uppdateras och pricka rätt plats.","1"
"183","SOS Alarm","Totalt värdelös, hade väldigt mycket högre förväntningar på appen, i mina ögon så kunde det vara någon som håller på och lära sig programmera som gjort denna, men antar att pengar som vanligt spelar in, billigaste budet...  Mej, kommer inte maila till någon support och berätta allt, har annat att göra...","1"
"184","SOS Alarm","Fungerar inte i Småland kanske är för typ Stockholm helt värdelös","1"
"185","SOS Alarm","Bra. Men appen mister ofta sin funktion gällande trafikolyckor, eftersom det är för liten radie så får man ofta notisen när man redan hamnat i kön vid olycksplatsen.

"190","SOS Alarm","Fick idag ”tillfälle” att använda appen för att kontakta 112 när en person föll illa och slog sig så blodet sprutade. Jag beskriver vilket område vi befinner oss i. Operatören frågar då, ”Ja men vilken stad”. Anledningen till att jag ringde via appen var ju just att min position skulle synas exakt istället för att använda den vanliga telefonen.  Nu var det absolut ingen fara för livet denna gång samt att jag viste exakt var vi befann oss. Men är man ute i trafiken på långresa kan ju ens position svara betydligt diffusare att beskriva.  Ni bör nog testa detta i större utsträckning! Har en iPhone 6a","4"

"195","SOS Alarm","Trots sirener till höger och vänster finns ingen information om detta i appen..?!","1"
"196","SOS Alarm","Jag använde appen i en nödsituation då jag ringde 112 och hade den då inställd på dela platsinfo vilket den inte gjorde. Det var huvudsaken varför jag laddade ner appen och har låtit den se min plats hela tiden under ett halvår men ändå fungerade den inte.","1"
"197","SOS Alarm","De va en skottlossning som hade skett här och det stod ingen varning om det i appen. Trots att en hel del poliser och helikoptrar va inblandade.","3"
"198","SOS Alarm","Appen är riktigt grym! Vi gillar att gå i skogen och hänger en del på skjutfältet, och appen bidrar till att det känns tryggt om det skulle hända något. Fortsätt göra mer, som kan bidra till trygghet!","5"

"203","SOS Alarm","Får meddelande att saker har hänt men helt omöjligt att hitta i appen? Har aldrig kunnat läsa någon händelse. Helt värdelöst.","1"
"204","SOS Alarm","Appen skulle vara ännu bättre om man kunde snabbt dela sin egen hälsoprofil när man ringer. Info om vilken portkod man har, adress, personnummer, vilka läkemedel man tar, allergier etc. Det mesta finns ju i journalen, men det skulle spara tid i en akut situation. Och för att hitta journalen behövs ju personuppgifter.   Jag var tvungen att ringa in en gång med bara någon procent batteri och var livrädd att jag inte skulle hinna förmedla tillräckligt mycket information. Allt som sparar tid är guld värt!","3"

"212","SOS Alarm","Det känns inte bra att info under Aktuella händelser inte visas när det kommer en pushnotis. Det kommer bara upp felmeddelande eller att det inte finns några händelser. Kanske klarar appen inte belastningen? Det känns iaf inte så stabilt...","3"
"213","SOS Alarm","Appen är en toppen idé och ett jättebra hjälpmedel för myndigheter att exempelvis komma ut med viktig information.  Problemet är dock att så fort någon info skickas ut och man öppnar appen för att läsa får man felmeddelande om nätverksfel i ett par minuter innan man kan läsa meddelandet. Det är som om att servern inte är dimensionerad för den trafik som uppstår.","3"

"231","SOS Alarm","Med en sådan här app så vill jag personligen inte ha en generell beskrivning som ”bugfixes & improvements” vid uppdateringar. Ta hellre ”Vi jobbar ständigt med förbättra er upplevelse av appen...” (inte jättebra heller men ni förstår kanske?). Eller skriv vad ni har fixat. Hur som helst, jag vill inte höra om buggar i en SOS app.","4"
"232","SOS Alarm","Mycket bra funktioner i appen. Ännu bättre blir den om man kan ringa med videosamtal för att snabbt kunna visa vad som händer eller om man är i en utsatt situation och inte kan prata.","4"
"233","SOS Alarm","Både jag o min fru har appen installerad men det har hänt flera gånger att hon har fått notiser om brand i närheten utan att jag har fått det. Har alla notiser påslagna både i appen och i inställningarna. Har nu provat att radera o installera om appen. Får se om det hjälper...","4"
"234","SOS Alarm","Appen har fått alla rättigheter den behöver, men trots det så kan den inte uppdatera ’aktuella händelser’. Inga notifieringar, inga händelser, bara en knapp för att ringa 112.   Det känns som att den här typen av app bör fungera bättre...","1"
"235","SOS Alarm","En mycket bra app men instämmer med en annan recensent om att det saknas en widget vid låst skärm. Har ett annat problem också. Appen frågar upprepande efter tillåtelse att se positionen i bakgrunden. Trots att jag har gett tillåtelse att alltid använda min position. Något irriterande.","5"
"236","SOS Alarm","Får notiser, men när jag kollar i appen finns inget aktuellt att läsa. Trots att min fru kan läsa i sin telefon om aktuella notiser.","1"
"237","SOS Alarm","Extremt seg och tuggar länge innan info om viktig händelse kommer upp. Den behöver snabbas på!!","3"
"238","SOS Alarm","”Nätverksfel” när den ska ladda aktuella händelser, men allting annat i telefonen funkar klanderfritt 🙄","2"
"239","SOS Alarm","Står att det hänt trafikolycka för 7 min sedan men sedan inga aktuella händelser...","1"
"240","SOS Alarm","Bra app.. Men äter upp ditt batteri då du måste tillåta platstjänster alltid för att få information/notiser.  Så nu kan man bara använda den om man går in och kollar efter man känner brandlukt eller hör sirener på håll.  Och då går man in och får bekräftat att de brinner och var de brinner. Ni måste fixa detta.. jag har haft iPhone i över 10år och vet ingen app under denna tid som fullkomligt tömmer batterikapaciteten på detta sätt..","3"
"241","SOS Alarm","Fantastisk app! Enda som saknas är stöd för Siri genväg t.ex om man säger ”Hej Siri ring SOS alarm” eller liknande så att man ringer genom appen för att positionen ska kunna komma med. Kan vara hjälpsamt om man t.ex skadat sig och inte kommer åt sin telefon","4"
"242","SOS Alarm","Det är jätte bra app👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻","4"
"243","SOS Alarm","Pissdålig app! Jag ger tillgång till min position, ger mitt nummer och aktiverar notiser....Men fick EN notis om en brand! Nu är det noll händelser! Bluff-app som vill kartlägga var personer befinner sig","1"
"244","SOS Alarm","Har appen men hade gärna önskat snabbare information..idag fick jag 16:55 att det va en trafikolycka i mitt närområde men när jag trycker på den så står det att den hände 13:45..","1"
"245","SOS Alarm","Skönt för mig som diabetiker att ha som extra trygghet. Det hade varit perfekt om man i sin profil kunde skriva att man (exempelvis) har diabetes typ 1, så ser larmpersonalen det om det skulle vara så att talet försvinner eller att man är så låg i blodsockret att man inte kan göra sig förstådd, för det händer ju dessvärre...","4"
"246","SOS Alarm","Hej!  Tack för en riktigt bra app, det enda jag saknar är att appen skulle fungera till Apple Watch då man endast har med den i vissa lägen.","5"
"247","SOS Alarm","Fungerar väldigt dåligt. Vem ansvarar för uppdateringarna för denna app. Finns det nån koppling till 112? Dyker upp ett fåtal saker i appen trots en stor mängd blåljushändelser omkring mig. Känns som lite fejk?","1"
"248","SOS Alarm","According to the latest data, 1 in 4 people living in Sweden is foreign born and not everyone here speaks Swedish yet, so it would be nice to have the app support the English language as well.","3"
"249","SOS Alarm","När en sak hände så behövde jag ringa och dem fråga fortarande vart jag är även fast jag ringde via appen","2"
"250","SOS Alarm","Och så blev appen sämre än innan...  Under ”Aktuellt” går det fortfarande inte att uppdatera samt att man nu inte alls kan ändra inställningarna för notiser.  Ladda inte ner denna version av appen då SOS Alarm helt misslyckats med den återigen.","2"
"251","SOS Alarm","Bra app... men slukar ditt batteri rätt fort.","3"

"254","SOS Alarm","Jättebra applikation, men huruvida den fungerar är oklart. Får varken uppdateringar i aktuellt-flödet och inte heller notifikationer om olyckor i min närhet. Har testat att installera om appen samt kollat igenom mina inställningar och den analyserar själv att den skall fungera optimalt; Till min förvåning gör den inte det. Hade velat att den fungerade.","2"
"255","SOS Alarm","Saknar tillgång till kamera för att kunna visa läget vid ev trafikolycka","4"

"259","SOS Alarm","Varför kan man inte välja en region om man inte har platstjänster på för notifieringar? Eller att välja att uppdatera region när man öppnar appen. Samt se notifieringar som skickats ut samma dag till den regionen.","4"
"260","SOS Alarm","gör så att appen kommer upp när man söker på ”112” på hemskärmen. hade svårt att hitta och det skulle vara bra när man har brottom och inte kan tänka på vad appen heter. istället ödslade jag någon minut helt förvirrad och sen kom jag på att ringa som vanligt istället, illa när man har bråttom och har svårt att tänka. annars funkade den bra en annan gång på min väns mobiltelefon för dem kunde se den exakta positionen vilket är jättebra","3"
"261","SOS Alarm","Ta bort info om att appen har använts dom sista 3 dagarna! Har ju godkänt platsinfot ”Alltid”!","4"

"263","SOS Alarm","Önskar en funktion där man kan lägga in hemadress och arbetsplatsen, då får man notiser kring dessa områden. Man kan få slippa GPS funktionen i bakgrunden och att den eventuellt slösar batteri. Behåll så som det ser ut just nu men lägg till gärna hem och arbetsplats adress funktion. Tack","5"

"268","SOS Alarm","Varför stängs appen ner var gång jag försöker komma in på den?","2"
"269","SOS Alarm","Bra att man kan få info om bränder i området. Önskar at man kunde få notis vid skjutningar och bombdåd också.","5"
"270","SOS Alarm","Mycket information! Har tyvärr inte rätt än, men skönt att inte behöva.😝. Jag säger 5 stars!🆘🆘❤️❤️","5"
"271","SOS Alarm","Skulle vara kul med 3D Touch men den är smidig och bra!👍👍👍 Rekommenderas!","4"
"272","SOS Alarm","Hur svårt ska det vara att fixa händelser i närheten? Står bara nätverksfel. Ja, alla inställningar är korrekta i telefon. T o m provat ominstallera appen.","1"
"273","SOS Alarm","Mycket bra app! Toppen med koordinater och karta. Vore toppen om man kunde få in ICE-nummer också.","5"
"274","SOS Alarm","Håller med att det saknas att man inte kan komma åt den i låst läge. Jag laddade ner den tidigare men hann inte skriva ner min kod sp jag raderade den för att ladda ner på nytt o då går det ej så nu har jag ingen alls.","3"
"275","SOS Alarm","Mycket bra idé och jag gillar att man får notiser när något händer i närheten.  Men! När jag skulle ringa 112 häromdagen när en bomb smällde utanför mitt hus, så öppnade jag appen men kunde inte se telefonknappen. Jag var alltså i chock och kunde inte urskilja den i allt det blåa. Bör inte en ”nödknapp” vara röd?","2"
"276","SOS Alarm","Tack vare denna app så kunde jag köra förbi en trafikolycka (genom att ta en annan väg) som hade korkat igen hela stan och därmed missade jag inte en viktig mötestid, woho! Däremot så stör jag mig på att historiken av händelser inte lagras. Ni svarar på alla andra att ”det försvinner när det inte är aktuellt längre” men kan ni något om mänsklig stress och psykologi? Hur det känns att ha 5-10 notiser på morgonen och sen inte kunna se detaljer för en enda grej? Har även fått notiser om trafikolyckor som försvunnit från appen pga att den enligt er inte är aktuell längre men likförbannat är vägen forfarande avstängd osv. Tycker verkligen historiken för notiser och detaljer borde sparas lite längre. Ett annat förslag är att välja ut vilka notiser man vill ha. Jag bryr mig inte särskilt om brand i byggnad eftersom det oftast är någon som bränt en kastrull i köket 2 km bort. Men trafikolyckor påverkar vardagen gravt så det ser jag gärna. Tackåhej!","3"
"277","SOS Alarm","Appen ”försvinner” när man inte använt den på ett tag. Måste laddas ner igen innan den kan användas vilket såklart inte är bra. Slår man ifrån app-avlastning i inställningarna så gäller det alla appar och det tar minne från telefonen så det vill man ju inte göra.","4"
"278","SOS Alarm","Händelser har slutat fungera. Står bara nätverksfel.","3"
"279","SOS Alarm","Får inte upp kartbild på aktuella händelser, bara min egen position och plats för händelse på ett rutnät.","3"
"280","SOS Alarm","Nätverksfel hela tiden","1"
"281","SOS Alarm","Uppdaterade till senaste version och appen kraschar vid uppstart. Hjälper inte att starta om telefonen eller appen. Annars en bra app.","4"
"282","SOS Alarm","För mig som bor i en tätbefolkad stadsdel ropar den varg med sina återkommande notiser om brand i byggnad, brinnande fordon osv. Jag vill bara få uttrycklig notis om brand om den verkligen är nära mig och i andra fall slippa notis eller få en mer neutralt laddad notistext typ ”Händelse i ditt närområde”. Som någon annan skrivit ser man ändå inte någon historik. Det känns dubbelt onödigt att se ”Brand i byggnad” det första man ser i mobilen på lördagsmorgonen och sedan inte ser något alls i appen. Totalt onödigt ångestpåslag. Vill också kunna få notiser om utvalda områden, åtminstone min egen bostad, även när jag befinner mig annanstans.","4"
"283","SOS Alarm","Har en ”dumtelefon”. Kan jag använda appen för att snabbt ange position, och använda det registrerade telefonen för samtal ?  Ett problem är att när jag startar appen anger den att min gps in är aktiv, vilket den är !","1"
"284","SOS Alarm","Som tidigare skrivit - saknar en widget så att man kan komma åt appen vid låst skärm. Vore jättebra om barnen kan komma åt den om det händer något med oss vuxna.","4"
"285","SOS Alarm","Bra app! Mkt bra sätt att få snabba uppdateringar om vad som ev händer i ens närområde. Saknar dock att man kan ange sin hemadress så att oavsett var man är så är det möjligt att få uppgift om ev händelser kring hemadress, viktigt vid tex brand.","4"
"286","SOS Alarm","Utmärkt app då jag arbetar i skogen med riskerna det innebär. Använder då iWatch med inbyggd telefon som har nödsamtal inbyggt men varför inte göra denna app iWatch-kompatibel?  Bra med notiser men jag skulle vilja ha själv SOS-appen högst upp i ”Docken” dvs då man bara behöver trycka på den avlånga knappen så kommer man dit direkt och kan larma om man ligger fast under ett träd.","4"
"287","SOS Alarm","Men saknar historik på de larm som gått ut.  Ser i notiser på skärmen att det varit tex ”Brand i bostad” men när jag går in i appen ser jag inget.","4"
"288","SOS Alarm","För denna appen är toppen, och viktig. Skapar trygghet när man rör sig ute ensam. Snabbåtkomst från låst skärm hade varit fantastiskt för att göra appen ännu mer lättillgänglig.","5"
"289","SOS Alarm","I de flesta ljussituationer, är det rejält svårt att orientera sig på kartan.  Om man t ex får en varning om inträffad händelse och ombeds undvika den och ta annan väg, så är det tyvärr en utmaning. Kartan har gul botten, vägar mm är ritade i något mörkare gult.  Personer med åldersförändringar när det gäller synen, gråstarr, oskärpa, stresspåslag, låg ljuskänslighet eller annat, behöver högre kontrast mellan viktiga detaljer i kartan. Föreslår att ni byter ut kartan till en tydligare sådan, gärna med möjlighet att växla till sattelitbild som alternativ.  Testa sedan gärna på ett antal äldre personer om det ändringen fungerar. Det är alltid bra för alla som hamnar i en utsatt situation att veta var man är.","4"
"290","SOS Alarm","En smart app som alltid kan komma att behöva användas! Ett krav man borde kunna ställa till Apple, eller respektive telefonmodell är att denna app alltid ska vara förinstallerad. Ytterligare en sak är att det borde finnas kortkommandon om man behöver komma åt den snabbare än att behöva logga in, hitta appen, klicka på appen, låta den ladda etc. kanske en widget ?","4"
"291","SOS Alarm","Bra info, men saknar notiser på Apple Watch","3"
"292","SOS Alarm","En liten fundering bara. När man har notis på och där man kan testa hur sin mobil funkar med larmet så efter man tryckt på testknappen och sen låser mobilen så kommer notis upp att de varit ett test. Går in och klickar / tar bort meddelandet om testet . Men sen finns de kvar en notis i alla fall, fast man tagit och klickat bort testet. De ligger kvar fast jag gjorde testet för flera dagar sen.","4"
"293","SOS Alarm","Irriterande att notiser i telefonen från samma dag/dygn inte går att hitta i appen när man går in i den. Förstår om det behöver rensas men 24h känns ändå som en relevant tidsperiod.","4"
"294","SOS Alarm","Ibland behöver man komma i kontakt med polisen i tystnad. Var finns den funktionen?","4"
"295","SOS Alarm","Perfekt app för alla tänkbara nödvändiga extremt akuta situationer, då man snabbt behöver kunna larma rätt myndighet.  Som andra har skrivit, så borde man även kunna ange personlig info om sin hälsa, som vårdpersonalen ev behöver veta i en akut situation, där det kan handla om liv eller död.  Det finns heller ingen möjlighet att ange någon nära anhörigs kontaktuppgifter.   Nu finns redan den möjligheten, att ange personlig info om min hälsa och vem som kan kontaktas i en akut situation, i min Iphone. Men det hade varit en fördel att även kunna ha det i just denna app, så infon hittas lättare.  Ett annat problem är att min position på kartan inte visar exakt var jag faktiskt befinner mig, som vanligt när det gäller automatisk positionering från min Iphone (denna gång är det en Iphone X).  Men varför gnäller så många om att det inte går att verifiera sitt mobilnr?  Det tog ca 5 sekunder för mig och jag angav INTE +46, utan endast mitt mobilnr, så det är mitt tips för att lyckas med verifieringen!  Och +46 är det KORREKTA landsnumret för Sverige, inte +47 som alla har angett här i recensionerna!  Det är kanske därför verifieringen misslyckas, om ni inte ens kan ange korrekt landsnr?!  Dessutom, kom ihåg att ett mobilnr ska anges så här om landsnumret krävs; +4670xxxxxxx. Alltså ska den första nollan i numret ALLTID tas bort, även när man ringer från en fast telefon (om det nu finns någon som fortfarande har det...)","5"
"296","SOS Alarm","Visar fel på 5 km ibland...","1"
"297","SOS Alarm","Det brinner i grannhuset. Sonens flickvän undrade om jag var ok då hon fått avisering. Jag har INTE fått nån avisering. Har kollat i både app o telefonens inställningar. Notiser tillåtna enlig konstens alla regler.  Händelsen var noterad i appen men jag fick inget ljud, inga brickor som notis. Tur att det inte var i mitt hus!  Känns sådär tryggt...","1"
"298","SOS Alarm","Det kommer varningar när det brinner eller har hänt något i området där man är. Jag har hittills fått två varningar och jag är jätte nöjd. Det är skönt att veta att jag kommer att få dessa varningar som gäller i just det området jag är. Rekommenderar varmt denna app","5"
"299","SOS Alarm","112 appen är riktigt bra. Fick ta och använda den i skarpt läge. Samtalet var tydligt och klart. Upptäckte dock en bugg, 112 operatören tappade min position så jag fick uppge den 2 gånger. Appen ska ge positionen direkt, men appen kunde inte skicka positionen tyvärr. Kan tilläggas att jag just uppdaterat både iOS och appen kanske har det med det att göra!? En riktigt bra app tycker jag.","4"
"300","SOS Alarm","Saknar lägenhets nummer och antal trappor Och port kod Med vänliga hälsningar ! Jocke Skulle gärna se ett globalt larm nummer Försäkring saknas också","5"
"301","SOS Alarm","Skulle vilja ha den på Applewatch","4"
"302","SOS Alarm","Bra, men får inte upp händelser i närheten!","3"
"303","SOS Alarm","Laddade ner den direkt när jag såg den. Enkel och utan allt för många saker man kan ta fel på. Som det ska vara. Borde finnas förinstallerad på alla telefonen. En sak kan man kanske önska: möjligheten att skicka sms och bild. Vore kanske bra för både operatör och uppringare?","5"
"304","SOS Alarm","Det här måste vara en av de nyttigaste apparna jag någonsin installerat. Man får direkt ett meddelande om något allvarligt hänt i närområdet. Idag fick jag tex meddelande om brand i närheten, redan innan räddningstjänsten ens hade hunnit rycka ut. Ovärderlig information!!","5"
"305","SOS Alarm","Borde vara bra om ni gjorde en funktion där man kunde kolla historik på händelser..","4"
"306","SOS Alarm","Bra app när/om olyckan är framme, och hjälp önskas!  Lika bra att få aktuell information om olyckor som Räddningstjänsten försöker att göra det som de är väldigt duktiga, och få möjligheten att välja en bättre väg och undvika att störa Räddningstjänstens arbete att hjälpa nödställd!   Rekommenderas!","5"
"307","SOS Alarm","Vad glad jag blev när jag läste om denna nyhet! Detta kommer underlätta otroligt mycket och i slutändan rädda liv!","5"
"308","SOS Alarm","Hade gärna sett HLR-instruktioner och lokalisering av hjärtstartare i appen. Även synk med apple watch hade varit bra.","4"
"309","SOS Alarm","Kan ni inte lägga in en funktion så att man kan rekommendera/skicka länken till appen till de man har i sina kontakter, så får ni ännu större spridning snabbare","5"
"310","SOS Alarm","En smart app som alla ska i sin mobil👍","5"
"311","SOS Alarm","Kanonbra app!","5"
"312","SOS Alarm","Jag kan inte ladda ner appen. Knappen ”Hämta” finns inte ...","1"
"313","SOS Alarm","Bra att det kommer ut en app för att kontakta 112! Har som tur är inte behövt använda den än så därför är det svårt att sätta ett betyg.   Skulle gärna se att man kunde lägga in frivillig info som vem man är, närmast anhörig, viktig sjukdomsinfo osv.","3"
"314","SOS Alarm","Bra och viktig app. I profil borde man kunna lägga in viktig personlig information som t.ex sjukdomar, funktionsnedsättningar, allergier, blodgrupp, närmast anhörig/a som automatiskt skickas till SOS tillsammans med position.","4"
"315","SOS Alarm","Bra att att ha i telefonen, hade dock varit bättre om den fungerade.","1"
"316","SOS Alarm","Bra app, men slukar batteriet tyvärr.","2"
"317","SOS Alarm","Bra app som alla bör ha!  Hade varit ännu bättre om man kunde lägga in sin hemadress för att få notiser om tex brand i ens bostadsområde när man inte är hemma.","5"
"318","SOS Alarm","Sedan jag installerat appen i telefonen drar mobilen mycket ström. Då har jag den ändå på plats-vid användning.","2"
"319","SOS Alarm","Snygg, enkel och drar nästan inget batteri.","5"
"320","SOS Alarm","Bra funktioner. Eftersom man måste använda appen för att platsinformationen ska delas när man ringer 112, skulle det vara värdefullt om det implementerades stöd för att ringa med appen genom att använda telefonens röstassistent.  För personer som inte är teknikvana, och för personer som använder hjälpmedel, kan det ta relativt lång tid att först få fram appen, och därefter komma till rätt menyval.","5"
"321","SOS Alarm","En bra början men saknar några saker, var finns koppling till Apple Watch, speciellt e-sim modellerna där du inte ens behöver telefon ? Apple Watch har en funktion där den ringer upp om klockan registrerar ett fall och du inte reagerar, dvs du är förmodligen livlös och ringer då automatiskt upp 112. Hur hanterar ni ett sådant larm ?","4"
"322","SOS Alarm","Bra app, men upptäckte att ”något” ibland händer med överföring av positionerings-data tex via sms Telefonen visar rätt position, men i meddelandet överförs en annan position  Tog skärmdump som jag gärna delar med mig av. Skiljer nästan en mil","5"
"323","SOS Alarm","Bra app ✌️  Fungerar den även på iPad att larma med?","3"
"324","SOS Alarm","En app som kan rädda liv! Har fått två notiser.","5"
"325","SOS Alarm","Jag skulle gärna vilja ha en app till Apple Watch också eftersom jag ibland lämnar telefonen hemma när jag springer och bara har med min Apple Watch.","5"
"326","SOS Alarm","SOS Alarm skickar information om händelser i min närhet därför behöver appen alltid positionera sig. Min plats skickas bara till SOS när jag ringer 112 via appen. Appen verkar också sparsam mot batteriet. Ett måste för alla i Sverige!","5"
"327","SOS Alarm","Jätte bra idé och appen är väldigt användarvänlig! Dock får ni jobba lite med gpsen. Sitter hemma vid köksbordet och då visar appen att jag är 300m bort från min faktiska position.","3"
"328","SOS Alarm","Hoppas aldrig jag måste använda appen, men när jag ska göra det vill jag kunna söka efter ”112” i telefonen, så gör det sökbart om ni nu ska kalla den 112-appen. Nu måste man leta upp den manuellt eller komma ihåg att den heter SOS Alarm.","5"
"329","SOS Alarm","Mycket viktig app som kan rädda liv!   Håller med andra recensenter att det borde läggas till en meddelandefunktion som möjliggör en nåbarhet för den som inte kan tala eller är i situationer där den nödställde inte kan prata.  Att på något sätt kunna nå appen om skärmen är låst är mycket önskvärt men det kanske är svårt då tekniken snarare ligger hos mobiltillverkaren.  Flera språk skulle också vara bra.","5"
"330","SOS Alarm","Bra tanke, men jag får inget SMS med verifieringskod. Jo, det är rätt telefonnummer och jag har avinstallerat appen två gånger...","1"
"331","SOS Alarm","Skulle vara bra om man kunde lägga in telefonnummer till anhörig.  Så de får besked om vad som hänt.   Jan-Peter Glans","3"
"332","SOS Alarm","När man söker efter appen får man ingen träff när man skriver ”112” i iOS sökfunktion. Jag gissar att det är någon metatag som måste till.  ”Sos” får man träff på men inte ”112”.  Jag tror det vore bra! Har dessvärre (eller turligt nog?) inte testat appens funktionalitet.","3"
"333","SOS Alarm","Går jag in på min position så visar den helt fel position.","2"
"334","SOS Alarm","Eftersom appen är så lätt att använda vid olyckor då man kan ringa från den och SOS kan se din position utan att du själv har en susning om var du är, kan man då inte lägga in en funktion där man som användare kan samtycka till att dela sin position hela tiden?  Dvs, om man valt att dela position hela tiden så syns man inte bara när man själv använder appen vid olycka, utan man kan även hittas om man själv försvinner pga olycka/brott där SOS kan pejla dig efter att en polisanmälan gjorts.  Nu kanske positionen redan delas oavsett, men vill man kunna bli pejlad trots att man inte anmäler exempelvis en olycka utan själv blivit drabbad, så måste man väl samtycka till det? Då behövs inga trianguleringar eller aktiva spårningsappar i övrigt. Bara en tanke....","4"
"335","SOS Alarm","Bra första intryck men efterlyser ett alternativ på engelska för de som ännu inte behärskar svenska","3"
"336","SOS Alarm","Folk klagar på att det inte går att verifiera sitt nummer. Skriv bara in ditt nummer som vanligt. I mitt fall 070x-xxXXxx. Inget +47 osv! Och så är problemet löst, mer simpelt än så blir det knappast.","5"
"337","SOS Alarm","Bra! Jag skulle dock gärna se en karta med all lokal live-data. - Vart ska ambulansen på gatan? - Varför luktar det rök i området? Vet att DN.se hade en sådan tjänst (från SOS) tidigare. Tack!","3"
"338","SOS Alarm","Viktig app, och jag hoppas utvecklarna snarast lägger in fler språk i appen så alla som är på besök i Sverige kan nyttja den fullt ut.","3"
"339","SOS Alarm","Har väntat på denna app länge. Ett tips är att även utveckla appen för ”smartklockor”.","5"
"340","SOS Alarm","That this app is also aimed for only people with Swedish Apple accounts is just idiotic. Such an app should be available for any account, foreigner and tourists would definitely have  harder time to exactly tell his or her’s whereabouts in a case of emergency.  Do as other SOS organizations have done, publish the app in all Apple AppStores and at least add English to the set of languages within the app.","1"
"341","SOS Alarm","Låt användaren välja om man vill dela position hela tiden eller endast vid samtal.  Möjlighet att välja vilken ort/plats som man vill ha VMA för vore också en klar fördel.","4"
"342","SOS Alarm","Hej! Vill inte verka negativ eller skeptisk.  Superbra app osv!! Tummen upp!! Men...kommer fler fall utredas nu? Eller är appen mest till för att stilla oroligheten och öka känslan av trygghet? Fick plötsligt polisen mer resurser och bemanning att utreda brott med hjälp av appen? Återigen...förlåt den skeptiska tonen! Jag menar väl och är oerhört pro-polis- och rättsväsende.","5"
"343","SOS Alarm","Kommer den till Apple Watch också?  Mycket bra i övrigt.","5"
"344","SOS Alarm","Har skrivit in mitt mobil nr 7 gånger med +47 som man ska göra plus vanligt men gnäller varje gång att (Det angivna telefon numret är inte giltigt vänligen försök igen) Riktigt bra början på en app man hade förhoppning på och alltid ska det krångla för vissa 🙈","1"

"348","SOS Alarm","Viktig app som kan vara avgörande i stressade situationer.  Dock vill man ju se att appen skickar position även om man ringer 112. Vid allvarlig skada är det ju inte alltid lätt att fippla med appar. Eller ens låsa upp telefonen.","5"
"349","SOS Alarm","’Nätverksfel, försök igen lite senare’ samt ’kunde inte uppdatera flödet’.  Nog för att många precis laddad ner appen men när något händer kommer ännu fler att försöka få info, från servrar som inte kan nås..

"5","Alertswiss","Hey ich habe in den letzten 12 stunden wegen den notrufnummern ca. 40 push meldungen für diverse standorte erhalten. Teilweise mit sirenengeräusch. Einmal hätte gereicht, das schaut sich kein mensch an","4"
"6","Alertswiss","Die Meldungen sind nützlich, aber wenn ich eine Benachrichtigung über eine neue Meldung antippe, lande ich einfach in der App, und sehe *alle* Meldungen, ohne Hinweis, welche denn neu ist. Es wäre viel besser, die angetippte Meldung direkt anzuzeigen.","3"
"7","Alertswiss","Warum man den Standortdienst ständig aktivieren soll ist mir schleierhaft. „Nur beim Verwenden“ wird nicht akzeptiert von der App, und somit landet es sogleich im Abfall. Brauche keinen unnötigen Batteriesauger der mir irgendwann mal vielleicht etwas interessantes melden könnte. Ich zweifle immer an der Integrität solcher Anwendungen die mehr Zugriff verlangen als sinnvoll und nötig.","1"
"8","Alertswiss","Super App, Ich hatte immer angst falls mal die Sirenen losgehen würden das ich nicht mal wüsste was passiert und wo ich hingehen müsste. Und der Notfallplan ist auch super!!  Danke Schweiz 💕","5"
"9","Alertswiss","Dunkler Modus wäre noch super :)","4"
"10","Alertswiss","Die Idee ist im Ansatz gut. Ich kann zwar Einstellungen vornehmen (es werden aber nicht alle akzeptiert) und kann dann nicht abgeschlossen werden. Einfach irgendwie zusammen geschusterte App. Schade.","1"
"11","Alertswiss","Diese App war mal gut. In der Zwischenzeit kennt sie nur noch Corona. Andere Alarme gibt es kaum noch. Ich habe diese App gelöscht.","1"
"12","Alertswiss","Kann man die Warnungen zum Coronavirus auch deaktivieren? Dann gäbe es für mich 1-2 Sterne mehr.","3"
"13","Alertswiss","Typisch eine App des Bundes! Die Push infos kommen 24h nach der veröffentlicht. Es zeigt sich somit sehr gut wie das CH Volk geschützt wird! Bitte umgehend korrigieren, andernfalls bringt diese App nichts.","1"

"15","Alertswiss","Schade, sind nicht für alle Kantone die aktuell gültigen Corona-Regeln aufgeführt. Das wäre ein echter Mehrwert.","3"
"16","Alertswiss","Finde die App übersichtlich und gut gestaltet. Kritikpunkte:  -Beim Feuer in Mendrisio wurde beim öffnen der App ein lauter Alarm Ton abgespielt. Hat mein Kind geweckt und war unnötig da ich im Kanton ZH war. Anzeige rot reicht nur Ton wenn ich direkt betroffen bin. -Informationen zu Covid sollten nicht über einen weiteren Link der Kantone abgerufen werden, sondern direkt in der Meldung (Zusammenfassung der Regeln anzeigen wäre praktisch)","5"
"17","Alertswiss","Hab die ganze Schweiz ausgewählt. Wäre schon wenn yfranz und italienische auch auf deutsch stehen würde, oder baut es so ein das es auf die eingestellt Kantone automatisch die richtige Sprachen kommt.

"18","Alertswiss","Warum sieht man auf der Einstiegsseite *NICHT*, WELCHE MELDUNG DIE NEUEST IST, die gerade mit push eingegangen ist ??  Eine absolut unbrauchbare Darstellung! Muss alle Meldungen abgrasen um evtl die Neuigkeit zu finden.  Welcher Programmierer denkt so wenig wenn er arbeitet,  und welcher Auftraggeber ( Behörde ) überlegt so wenig wie eine brauchbare, informative, auf den Nutzer zugeschnittene Darstellung sein muss,  um den vollen Nutzen dieser wichtigen Informationen, an die Bevölkerung zu bringen ?  So wie es jetzt ist, ist diese App unbrauchbar!","1"
"19","Alertswiss","Verschiedene Sprachen in einer Meldung durcheinander gemixt. Sprachwahl unbedingt ermöglichen. Englisch zusätzlich. Alarm 🚨 ist sonst nutzlos. App wirkt unaufgeräumt. Eine gute Idee wurde leider ganz schlecht gelöst. Schade.","1"

"28","Alertswiss","Die App ist eine gute Sache. Bin aber im Tessin in den Frien. Was nützen mir da wertvolle Warnhinweise wenn diese auf Italienisch erscheinen und ich die Spache nicht kann? Somit in diesem Fall nicht brauchbar. Hier ist verbesserung angesagt.","4"
"29","Alertswiss","Wohne 30 Minuten vom Kanton SH entfernt, bekomme aber nur diese Alarme und nicht die von ZH. Sirenentest die Woche kam um 14 Uhr für SH (Test war 13:30 in ZH) und abends nach 18 Uhr als schweizweiter Hinweis. Im Nachhinein kann ich es auch in einem Newsportal lesen…","3"

"36","Alertswiss","Eigentlich eine super Sache. Was nützt mir die App jedoch, wenn ich als Deutschschweizer die Warnungen z.B. im Tessin nur auf italienisch bekomme?? Oder habe ich da eine Einstellung übersehen?","3"
"37","Alertswiss","Wenn die App-sprache Deutsch ausgewählt ist, werden Meldungen zum Tessin trotzdem auf Italienisch angezeigt, was sinnlos ist.","3"
"38","Alertswiss","Habe die App wieder gelöscht, da (1) Standortdaten dauernd aktiviert sein müssen (Datenkrake) und (2) das Sirenengeheul bei Alarm einfach peinlich ist. Das geht auch dezenter. Ansonsten OK.","3"
"39","Alertswiss","Die App wäre gut. Leider stürzt sie immer wieder ab.","3"
"40","Alertswiss","Mindestens die Hälfte der enthaltenen Links z.B. zum BABS, BAG etc. führen zu einer Fehlermeldung. Nicht besonders hilfreich, und auch nicht vertrauenserweckend.","3"
"41","Alertswiss","Jedoch wäre es, aus meiner Sicht, sinnvoll die meldungen in Deutsch, Italienisch und Französisch zu senden. Da nicht jeder Deutschschweizer perfekt Franzöisch kann und nicht jeder aus der Französisch sprechenden Schweiz auch noch Italienisch kann. Vielen Dank","4"
"42","Alertswiss","L’application est très bien et les alertes sont utiles. J’apprécie qu’elle regroupe différentes catégories comme les fermetures de tronçons importants, catastrophes naturelles etc.  Par contre le son d’alarme est horrible, c’est une bonne idée d’avoir voulu reproduire le son des alarmes suisses, mais dans la réalité c’est particulièrement dérangeant. Il serait bien de pouvoir choisir un son","4"

"50","Alertswiss","Schlechte und zu generelle Information. Das Sirenengeheul (mag für Kinder lustig sein) muss abgestellt werden können und ist äusserst schmerzhaft laut: direkt über Hörapparate ins Ohr mit weiterer Gehörschädigung als Folge.

Ausserdem sehe ich absolut keinen Mehrwert darin, eine gleichartige Information mehr als einmal zu pushen. Am Ende lauft es nämlich daraufhin hinaus, dass die Push Notifikation für die App blockiert oder die App komplett gelöscht wird. > Totalschaden. Schöne Weihnachten.","1"
"54","Alertswiss","Ich würde es sehr begrüssen, wenn die französischen und italienische Meldungen auch übersetzt würde und umgekehrt natürlich auch","4"

Ich beherrsche deswegen nicht gleich fr oder it. Nachrichten ausblenden oder hiden, wäre super. Mir ist wichtig das ich über Katastrophen informiert werde, wenn es dabei um mich geht.

Nun bekommt man auch mehrfach die Meldungen des Coronavirus. Langsam aber sicher habe ich von der App genug!","1"

"102","Alertswiss","... sie sollte meiner Meinung nach nur bei wirklichen Notfällen verwendet werden. Basel-Stadt z. Bsp. gibt Meldungen raus für Staus auf der Autobahn, dabei handelt es sich nicht um einen Notstand! Das gehört in die Verkehrsmeldungen aber nicht in diese App. Ansonsten läuft man in Gefahr, dass Nachrichten nicht mehr richtig gelesen werden weil sie normalerweise keine Wichtigkeit haben.

"119","Alertswiss","Weil die App nur selten gebraucht wird.. wurde sie bei mir automatisch ausgelagert und so bekam ich keine Notfallmeldungen mehr, dachte aber ich bekäme sie noch..","4"
"120","Alertswiss","Eine sehr sinnvolle und wichtige App  Insbesondere darum, weil ja die Klassischen Telefonbücher quasi abgeschafft wurden. ((Bedeutung Sirenenalarm letzte Seiten)  Sehr gut finde ich das die Alarmierung (Push) nach Region/Standort gewählt werden kann. Auch der Integrierte Notfallplan macht Sinn. Ich persönlich habe zwar Bedenken wegen des Datenschutzes.  Ich hoffe das weiter innovativ an der App weitergearbeitet wird,  denn ich wünschte mir das in Zukunft die App auch im Darkthema geben wird (Akkuleistung). Auch währe es Sinnvoll in der App sämtliche Notfallnummern zu integrieren.  Im ganzen eine Lobenswerte und gut durchdachte App.  👍👍  Danke.","4"
"121","Alertswiss","Eigentlich mag ich die App sehr, aber man sollte die Sprache in der App ändern können. Besten Dank im Voraus!","4"
"122","Alertswiss","Die App finde ich echt sinnvoll, nur das permanente tracking kostet Akku und müste nicht sein. Beim verwenden der App kann mans ja noch erlauben lassen.

Bluetooth fonksiyonu kullanarak yayın yapabilme, akıllı saatlerde kaybolan telefonu bulma fonksiyonuna benzer uzaklık yakınlık ölçme başlatma (sıcak soğuk oyunu benzeri, uzaktan alarm da çaldırabilir arama kurtarmacılar, telefon kazazedenin yakınında oluyor genelde)  3. SMS ile koordinat gönderebilme.   4. Telsizden iletmek üzere Mors kodu seslendirme ve gelen mors kodunu yazıya çevirme.  5. Aile üyelerini TC kimlik No ile teyidi şartı ile önceden verilecek onayla afet anında buluşmasını sağlamak için mevcut anlık konumlarını haritada gösterme. Bazı özellikler afet ilanı sonrası açılabilir suistimal edilmemesi için.
